<p>Once upon a time, Dan and Una, brother and sister, living in the English country,
  had the good fortune to meet with Puck, <i>alias</i> Robin Goodfellow, <i>alias</i>
  Nick o&rsquo; Lincoln, <i>alias</i> Lob-lie-by-the-Fire, the last survivor in England
  of those whom mortals call Fairies. Their proper name, of course, is &lsquo;The People
  of the Hills.&rsquo; This Puck, by means of the magic of Oak, Ash, and Thorn, gave the
  children power&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">To see what they should see and hear what they should
      hear,</span><br />
      <span class="i2">Though it should have happened three thousand year.</span><br />
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The result was that from time to time, and in different places on the farm and in
  the fields and the country about, they saw and talked to some rather interesting
  people. One of these, for instance, was a Knight of the Norman Conquest, another a
  young Centurion of a Roman Legion stationed in England, another a builder and decorator
  of King Henry VII.&rsquo;s time; and so on and so forth;<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> as I have tried to explain in a book
  called <i>Puck of Pook&rsquo;s Hill</i>.</p>

  <p>A year or so later, the children met Puck once more, and though they were then older
  and wiser, and wore boots regularly instead of going bare-footed when they got the
  chance, Puck was as kind to them as ever, and introduced them to more people of the old
  days.</p>

  <p>He was careful, of course, to take away their memory of their walks and
  conversations afterwards, but otherwise he did not interfere; and Dan and Una would
  find the strangest sort of persons in their gardens or woods.</p>

  <p>In the stories that follow I am trying to tell something about those people.</p>

  <p>When Dan and Una had arranged to go out before breakfast, they did not remember it
  was Midsummer Morning. They only wanted to see the otter which, old Hobden said, had
  been fishing their brook for weeks; and early morning was the time to surprise him. As
  they tiptoed out of the house into the wonderful stillness, the church clock struck
  five. Dan took a few steps across the dew-blobbed lawn, and looked at his black
  footprints.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I think we ought to be kind to our poor boots,&rsquo; he said.
  &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll get horrid wet.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>It was their first Summer in boots, and they hated them, so they took them off, and
  slung them round their necks, and paddled joyfully over the dripping turf where the
  shadows lay the wrong way, like evening in the East.</p>

  <p>The sun was well up and warm, but by the brook the last of the night mist still
  fumed off the water. They picked up the chain of otter&rsquo;s footprints on the mud,
  and followed it from the bank, between the weeds and the drenched mowing, while the
  birds shouted with surprise. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg
  4]</a></span> the track left the brook and became a smear, as though a log had been
  dragged along.</p>

  <p>They traced it into Three Cows meadow, over the mill-sluice to the Forge, round
  Hobden&rsquo;s garden, and then up the slope till it ran out on the short turf and fern
  of Pook&rsquo;s Hill, and they heard the cock-pheasants crowing in the woods behind
  them.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No use!&rsquo; said Dan, questing like a puzzled hound. &lsquo;The
  dew&rsquo;s drying off, and old Hobden says otters&rsquo;ll travel for
  miles.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve travelled miles.&rsquo; Una fanned herself with
  her hat. &lsquo;How still it is! It&rsquo;s going to be a regular roaster.&rsquo; She
  looked down the valley, where no chimney yet smoked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hobden&rsquo;s up!&rsquo; Dan pointed to the open door of the Forge cottage.
  &lsquo;What d&rsquo;you suppose he has for breakfast?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;One of <i>them</i>. He says they eat good all times of the year.&rsquo; Una
  jerked her head at some stately pheasants going down to the brook for a drink.</p>

  <p>A few steps farther on a fox broke almost under their bare feet, yapped, and trotted
  off.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah, Mus&rsquo; Reynolds&mdash;Mus&rsquo; Reynolds&rsquo;&mdash;Dan was
  quoting from old Hobden,&mdash;&lsquo;if I knowed all you knowed, I&rsquo;d know
  something.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
  class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; Una lowered her voice, &lsquo;you know that funny feeling of
  things having happened before. I felt it when you said &ldquo;Mus&rsquo;
  Reynolds.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So did I,&rsquo; Dan began. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They faced each other stammering with excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wait a shake! I&rsquo;ll remember in a minute. Wasn&rsquo;t it something
  about a fox&mdash;last year. Oh, I nearly had it then!&rsquo; Dan cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Be quiet!&rsquo; said Una, prancing excitedly.&lsquo;There was something
  happened before we met the fox last year. Hills! Broken Hills&mdash;the play at the
  theatre&mdash;see what you see&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I remember now,&rsquo; Dan shouted. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as plain as the nose on
  your face&mdash;Pook&rsquo;s Hill&mdash;Puck&rsquo;s Hill&mdash;Puck!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I remember, too,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s Midsummer Day
  again!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The young fern on a knoll rustled, and Puck walked out, chewing a green-topped
  rush.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Good Midsummer Morning to you. Here&rsquo;s a happy meeting,&rsquo; said he.
  They shook hands all round, and asked questions.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve wintered well,&rsquo; he said after a while, and looked them up
  and down. &lsquo;Nothing much wrong with you, seemingly.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve put us into boots,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Look at my
  feet&mdash;they&rsquo;re all pale white, and my toes are squdged together
  awfully.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;boots make a difference,&rsquo; Puck wriggled his brown, square,
  hairy foot, and cropped a dandelion flower between the big toe and the next.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I could do that&mdash;last year,&rsquo; Dan said dismally, as he tried and
  failed. &lsquo;And boots simply ruin one&rsquo;s climbing.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There must be some advantage to them, I suppose,&rsquo; said Puck, &lsquo;or
  folk wouldn&rsquo;t wear them. Shall we come this way?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They sauntered along side by side till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"
  id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> reached the gate at the far end of the hillside. Here
  they halted just like cattle, and let the sun warm their backs while they listened to
  the flies in the wood.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Little Lindens is awake,&rsquo; said Una, as she hung with her chin on the
  top rail. &lsquo;See the chimney smoke?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;To-day&rsquo;s Thursday, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; Puck turned to look at the
  old pink farmhouse across the little valley. &lsquo;Mrs. Vincey&rsquo;s baking day.
  Bread should rise well this weather.&rsquo; He yawned, and that set them both
  yawning.</p>

  <p>The bracken about rustled and ticked and shook in every direction. They felt that
  little crowds were stealing past.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that sound like&mdash;er&mdash;the People of the Hills?&rsquo;
  said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the birds and wild things drawing up to the woods before people
  get about,&rsquo; said Puck, as though he were Ridley the keeper.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, we know that. I only said it sounded like.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;As I remember &rsquo;em, the People of the Hills used to make more noise.
  They&rsquo;d settle down for the day rather like small birds settling down for the
  night. But that was in the days when they carried the high hand. Oh, me! The deeds that
  I&rsquo;ve had act and part in, you&rsquo;d scarcely believe!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I like that!&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;After all you told us last year,
  too!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Only, the minute you went away, you made us forget everything,&rsquo; said
  Una.</p>

  <p>Puck laughed and shook his head. &lsquo;I shall this<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> year, too. I&rsquo;ve given you seizin of Old
  England, and I&rsquo;ve taken away your Doubt and Fear, but your memory and remembrance
  between whiles I&rsquo;ll keep where old Billy Trott kept his night-lines&mdash;and
  that&rsquo;s where he could draw &rsquo;em up and hide &rsquo;em at need. Does that
  suit?&rsquo; He twinkled mischievously.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s got to suit,&rsquo; said Una, and laughed. &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t
  magic back at you.&rsquo; She folded her arms and leaned against the gate.
  &lsquo;Suppose, now, you wanted to magic me into something&mdash;an otter? Could
  you?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not with those boots round your neck.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take them off.&rsquo; She threw them on the turf. Dan&rsquo;s
  followed immediately. &lsquo;Now!&rsquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Less than ever now you&rsquo;ve trusted me. Where there&rsquo;s true faith,
  there&rsquo;s no call for magic.&rsquo; Puck&rsquo;s slow smile broadened all over his
  face.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But what have boots to do with it?&rsquo; said Una, perching on the gate.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s cold iron in them,&rsquo; said Puck, and settled beside her.
  &lsquo;Nails in the soles, I mean. It makes a difference.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you feel it does? You wouldn&rsquo;t like to go back to bare feet
  again, same as last year, would you? Not really?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No&mdash;o. I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;not for always. I&rsquo;m
  growing up, you know,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But you told us last year, in the Long Slip&mdash;at the theatre&mdash;that
  you didn&rsquo;t mind Cold Iron,&rsquo; said Dan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"
  id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t; but folk in housen, as the People of the Hills call
  them, must be ruled by Cold Iron. Folk in housen are born on the near side of Cold
  Iron&mdash;there&rsquo;s iron in every man&rsquo;s house, isn&rsquo;t there? They
  handle Cold Iron every day of their lives, and their fortune&rsquo;s made or spoilt by
  Cold Iron in some shape or other. That&rsquo;s how it goes with Flesh and Blood, and
  one can&rsquo;t prevent it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see. How do you mean?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It would take me some time to tell you.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s ever so long to breakfast,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;We looked
  in the larder before we came out.&rsquo; He unpocketed one big hunk of bread and Una
  another, which they shared with Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Little Lindens&rsquo; baking,&rsquo; he said, as his white teeth
  sunk in it. &lsquo;I know Mrs. Vincey&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo; He ate with a slow sideways
  thrust and grind, just like old Hobden, and, like Hobden, hardly dropped a crumb. The
  sun flashed on Little Lindens&rsquo; windows, and the cloudless sky grew stiller and
  hotter in the valley.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;Cold Iron,&rsquo; he said at last to the impatient children.
  &lsquo;Folk in housen, as the People of the Hills say, grow so careless about Cold
  Iron. They&rsquo;ll nail the Horseshoe over the front door, and forget to put it over
  the back. Then, some time or other, the People of the Hills slip in, find the
  cradle-babe in the corner, and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I know. Steal it and leave a changeling,&rsquo; Una cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Puck firmly. &lsquo;All that talk of changelings is
  people&rsquo;s excuse for their own neglect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id=
  "Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> Never believe &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;d whip &rsquo;em at the
  cart-tail through three parishes if I had my way.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But they don&rsquo;t do it now,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Whip, or neglect children? Umm! Some folks and some fields never alter. But
  the People of the Hills didn&rsquo;t work any changeling tricks. They&rsquo;d tiptoe in
  and whisper, and weave round the cradle-babe in the chimney-corner&mdash;a fag-end of a
  charm here, or half a spell there&mdash;like kettles singing; but when the babe&rsquo;s
  mind came to bud out afterwards, it would act differently from other people in its
  station. That&rsquo;s no advantage to man or maid. So I wouldn&rsquo;t allow it with my
  folks&rsquo; babies here. I told Sir Huon so once.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Who was Sir Huon?&rsquo; Dan asked, and Puck turned on him in quiet
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Sir Huon of Bordeaux&mdash;he succeeded King Oberon. He had been a bold
  knight once, but he was lost on the road to Babylon, a long while back. Have you ever
  heard, &ldquo;How many miles to Babylon?"&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Dan, flushing.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, Sir Huon was young when that song was new. But about tricks on mortal
  babies. I said to Sir Huon in the fern here, on just such a morning as this: &ldquo;If
  you crave to act and influence on folk in housen, which I know is your desire, why
  don&rsquo;t you take some human cradle-babe by fair dealing, and bring him up among
  yourselves on the far side of Cold Iron&mdash;as Oberon did in time past? Then you
  could make him a splendid fortune, and send him out into the world?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Time past is past time,&rdquo; says Sir Huon. &ldquo;I<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> doubt if we could do it.
  For one thing, the babe would have to be taken without wronging man, woman, or child.
  For another, he&rsquo;d have to be born on the far side of Cold Iron&mdash;in some
  house where no Cold Iron ever stood; and for yet the third, he&rsquo;d have to be kept
  from Cold Iron all his days till we let him find his fortune. No, it&rsquo;s not
  easy,&rdquo; he said, and he rode off, thinking. You see, Sir Huon had been a man
  once.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I happened to attend Lewes Market next Woden&rsquo;s Day even, and watched
  the slaves being sold there&mdash;same as pigs are sold at Robertsbridge Market
  nowadays. Only, the pigs have rings on their noses, and the slaves had rings round
  their necks.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What sort of rings?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A ring of Cold Iron, four fingers wide, and a thumb thick, just like a quoit,
  but with a snap to it for to snap round the slave&rsquo;s neck. They used to do a big
  trade in slave-rings at the Forge here, and ship them to all parts of Old England,
  packed in oak sawdust. But, as I was saying, there was a farmer out of the Weald who
  had bought a woman with a babe in her arms, and he didn&rsquo;t want any encumbrances
  to her driving his beasts home for him.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Beast himself!&rsquo; said Una, and kicked her bare heel on the gate.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So he blamed the auctioneer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; my baby,&rdquo;
  the wench puts in. &ldquo;I took it off a woman in our gang who died on Terrible Down
  yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it off to the Church then,&rdquo; says the
  farmer. &ldquo;Mother Church&rsquo;ll make a monk of it, and we&rsquo;ll step along
  home."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;It was dusk then. He slipped down to St. Pancras&rsquo; Church, and laid the
  babe at the cold chapel door. I breathed on the back of his stooping
  neck&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve <i>heard</i> he never could be warm at any fire
  afterwards. I should have been surprised if he could! Then I whipped up the babe, and
  came flying home here like a bat to his belfry.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;On the dewy break of morning of Thor&rsquo;s own day&mdash;just such a day as
  this&mdash;I laid the babe outside the Hill here, and the People flocked up and
  wondered at the sight.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought him, then?&rdquo; Sir Huon said, staring like any
  mortal man.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s brought his mouth with him too,&rdquo; I said. The
  babe was crying loud for his breakfast.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What is he?&rdquo; says Sir Huon, when the womenfolk had drawn him
  under to feed him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Full Moon and Morning Star may know,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
  don&rsquo;t. By what I could make out of him in the moonlight, he&rsquo;s without brand
  or blemish. I&rsquo;ll answer for it that he&rsquo;s born on the far side of Cold Iron,
  for he was born under a shaw on Terrible Down, and I&rsquo;ve wronged neither man,
  woman, nor child in taking him, for he is the son of a dead slave woman."</p>

  <p>&lsquo;"All to the good, Robin,&rdquo; Sir Huon said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be the less
  anxious to leave us. Oh, we&rsquo;ll give him a splendid fortune, and he shall act and
  influence on folk in housen as we have always craved.&rdquo; His Lady came up then, and
  drew him under to watch the babe&rsquo;s wonderful doings.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Who was his Lady?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Lady Esclairmonde. She had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
  id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> woman once, till she followed Sir Huon across the fern,
  as we say. Babies are no special treat to me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve watched too many of
  them&mdash;so I stayed on the Hill. Presently I heard hammering down at the Forge
  there,&rsquo; Puck pointed towards Hobden&rsquo;s cottage. &lsquo;It was too early for
  any workmen, but it passed through my mind that the breaking day was Thor&rsquo;s own
  day. A slow North-East wind blew up and set the oaks sawing and fretting in a way I
  remembered; so I slipped over to see what I could see.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And what did you see?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A smith forging something or other out of Cold Iron. When it was finished, he
  weighed it in his hand (his back was towards me), and tossed it from him a longish
  quoit-throw down the valley. I saw Cold Iron flash in the sun, but I couldn&rsquo;t
  quite make out where it fell. <i>That</i> didn&rsquo;t trouble me. I knew it would be
  found sooner or later by some one.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How did you know?&rsquo; Dan went on.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Because I knew the Smith that made it,&rsquo; said Puck quietly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wayland Smith?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Una suggested.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No. I should have passed the time o&rsquo; day with Wayland Smith, of course.
  This other was different. So&rsquo;&mdash;Puck made a queer crescent in the air with
  his finger&mdash;&lsquo;I counted the blades of grass under my nose till the wind
  dropped and he had gone&mdash;he and his Hammer.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Was it Thor then?&rsquo; Una murmured under her breath.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Who else? It was Thor&rsquo;s own day.&rsquo; Puck repeated the sign.
  &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell Sir Huon or his Lady what I&rsquo;d seen. Borrow trouble for
  yourself if that&rsquo;s your nature, but don&rsquo;t lend it to your neighbours.
  Moreover, I might have been mistaken about the Smith&rsquo;s work. He might have been
  making things for mere amusement, though it wasn&rsquo;t like him, or he might have
  thrown away an old piece of made iron. One can never be sure. So I held my tongue and
  enjoyed the babe. He was a wonderful child&mdash;and the People of the Hills were so
  set on him, they wouldn&rsquo;t have believed me. He took to me wonderfully. As soon as
  he could walk he&rsquo;d putter forth with me all about my Hill here. Fern makes soft
  falling! He knew when day broke on earth above, for he&rsquo;d thump, thump, thump,
  like an old buck-rabbit in a bury, and I&rsquo;d hear him say &ldquo;Opy!&rdquo; till
  some one who knew the Charm let him out, and then it would be &ldquo;Robin!
  Robin!&rdquo; all round Robin Hood&rsquo;s barn, as we say, till he&rsquo;d found
  me.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The dear!&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to have seen him!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, he was a boy. And when it came to learning his words&mdash;spells and
  such like&mdash;he&rsquo;d sit on the Hill in the long shadows, worrying out bits of
  charms to try on passers-by. And when the bird flew to him, or the tree bowed to him
  for pure love&rsquo;s sake (like everything else on my Hill), he&rsquo;d shout,
  &ldquo;Robin! Look&mdash;see! Look, see, Robin!&rdquo; and sputter out some spell or
  other that they had taught him, <i>all</i> wrong end first, till I hadn&rsquo;t the
  heart to tell him it was his own dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id=
  "Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> self and not the words that worked the wonder. When he got
  more abreast of his words, and could cast spells for sure, as we say, he took more and
  more notice of things and people in the world. People, of course, always drew him, for
  he was mortal all through.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Seeing that he was free to move among folk in housen, under or over Cold
  Iron, I used to take him along with me night-walking, where he could watch folk, and I
  could keep him from touching Cold Iron. That wasn&rsquo;t so difficult as it sounds,
  because there are plenty of things besides Cold Iron in housen to catch a boy&rsquo;s
  fancy. He <i>was</i> a handful, though! I shan&rsquo;t forget when I took him to Little
  Lindens&mdash;his first night under a roof. The smell of the rushlights and the bacon
  on the beams&mdash;they were stuffing a feather-bed too, and it was a drizzling warm
  night&mdash;got into his head. Before I could stop him&mdash;we were hiding in the
  bakehouse&mdash;he&rsquo;d whipped up a storm of wildfire, with flashlights and voices,
  which sent the folk shrieking into the garden, and a girl overset a hive there,
  and&mdash;of course <i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t know till then such things could touch
  him&mdash;he got badly stung, and came home with his face looking like kidney
  potatoes!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You can imagine how angry Sir Huon and Lady Esclairmonde were with poor
  Robin! They said the Boy was never to be trusted with me night-walking any
  more&mdash;and he took about as much notice of their order as he did of the bee-stings.
  Night after night, as soon as it was dark, I&rsquo;d pick up his whistle in the wet
  fern, and off we&rsquo;d flit together among folk in housen till break<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> of day&mdash;he asking
  questions, and I answering according to my knowledge. Then we fell into mischief
  again!&rsquo; Puck shook till the gate rattled.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We came across a man up at Brightling who was beating his wife with a bat in
  the garden. I was just going to toss the man over his own woodlump when the Boy jumped
  the hedge and ran at him. Of course the woman took her husband&rsquo;s part, and while
  the man beat him, the woman scratted his face. It wasn&rsquo;t till I danced among the
  cabbages like Brightling Beacon all ablaze that they gave up and ran indoors. The
  Boy&rsquo;s fine green-and-gold clothes were torn all to pieces, and he had been welted
  in twenty places with the man&rsquo;s bat, and scratted by the woman&rsquo;s nails to
  pieces. He looked like a Robertsbridge hopper on a Monday morning.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo; said he, while I was trying to clean him down with a
  bunch of hay, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand folk in housen. I went to help
  that old woman, and she hit me, Robin!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What else did you expect?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That was the one time
  when you might have worked one of your charms, instead of running into three times your
  weight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I caught the man one
  on the head that was as good as any charm. Did you see it work, Robin?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mind your nose,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Bleed it on a dockleaf&mdash;not
  your sleeve, for pity&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; I knew what the Lady Esclairmonde would
  say.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t care. He was as happy as a<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> gipsy with a stolen pony,
  and the front part of his gold coat, all blood and grass stains, looked like ancient
  sacrifices.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Of course the People of the Hills laid the blame on me. The Boy could do
  nothing wrong, in their eyes.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are bringing him up to act and influence on folk in housen, when
  you&rsquo;re ready to let him go,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s begun to do it,
  why do you cry shame on me? That&rsquo;s no shame. It&rsquo;s his nature drawing him to
  his kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want him to begin <i>that</i> way,&rdquo; the Lady
  Esclairmonde said. &ldquo;We intend a splendid fortune for him&mdash;not your
  flitter-by-night, hedge-jumping, gipsy-work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you, Robin,&rdquo; says Sir Huon, &ldquo;but I
  <i>do</i> think you might look after the Boy more closely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept him away from Cold Iron these sixteen years,&rdquo; I
  said. &ldquo;You know as well as I do, the first time he touches Cold Iron he&rsquo;ll
  find his own fortune, in spite of everything you intend for him. You owe me something
  for that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Sir Huon, having been a man, was going to allow me the right of it, but the
  Lady Esclairmonde, being the Mother of all Mothers, over-persuaded him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very grateful,&rdquo; Sir Huon said, &ldquo;but we think
  that just for the present you are about too much with him on the Hill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Though you have said it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will give you a
  second chance.&rdquo; I did not like being called to account for my doings on my own
  Hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> I
  wouldn&rsquo;t have stood it even that far except I loved the Boy.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; says the Lady Esclairmonde. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never any
  trouble when he&rsquo;s left to me and himself. It&rsquo;s your fault.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You have said it,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Hear me! From now on till
  the Boy has found his fortune, whatever that may be, I vow to you all on my Hill, by
  Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, <i>and</i> by the Hammer of Asa Thor"&rsquo;&mdash;again Puck
  made that curious double-cut in the air&mdash;&lsquo;&ldquo;that you may leave me out
  of all your counts and reckonings.&rdquo; Then I went out&rsquo;&mdash;he snapped his
  fingers&mdash;&lsquo;like the puff of a candle, and though they called and cried, they
  made nothing by it. I didn&rsquo;t promise not to keep an eye on the Boy, though. I
  watched him close&mdash;close&mdash;close!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When he found what his people had forced me to do, he gave them a piece of
  his mind, but they all kissed and cried round him, and being only a boy, he came over
  to their way of thinking (I don&rsquo;t blame him), and called himself unkind and
  ungrateful; and it all ended in fresh shows and plays, and magics to distract him from
  folk in housen. Dear heart alive! How he used to call and call on me, and I
  couldn&rsquo;t answer, or even let him know that I was near!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not even once?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;If he was very lonely?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, he couldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Dan, who had been thinking.
  &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you swear by the Hammer of Thor that you wouldn&rsquo;t,
  Puck?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;By that Hammer!&rsquo; was the deep rumbled reply. Then he came back to his
  soft speaking voice. &lsquo;And the Boy <i>was</i> lonely, when he couldn&rsquo;t see
  me any more. He began to try to learn all learning (he had good teachers), but I saw
  him lift his eyes from the big black books towards folk in housen all the time. He
  studied song-making (<ins class="correction" title=
  "original: good teacher she had too!">good teacher he had too!</ins>), but he sung
  those songs with his back toward the Hill, and his face toward folk. <i>I</i> know! I
  have sat and grieved over him grieving within a rabbit&rsquo;s jump of him. Then he
  studied the High, Low, and Middle Magic. He had promised the Lady Esclairmonde he would
  never go near folk in housen; so he had to make shows and shadows for his mind to chew
  on.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What sort of shows?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Just boy&rsquo;s magic as we say. I&rsquo;ll show you some, some time. It
  pleased him for the while, and it didn&rsquo;t hurt any one in particular except a few
  men coming home late from the taverns. But I knew what it was a sign of, and I followed
  him like a weasel follows a rabbit. As good a boy as ever lived! I&rsquo;ve seen him
  with Sir Huon and the Lady Esclairmonde stepping just as they stepped to avoid the
  track of Cold Iron in a furrow, or walking wide of some old ash-tot because a man had
  left his swop-hook or spade there; and all his heart aching to go straightforward among
  folk in housen all the time. Oh, a good boy! They always intended a fine fortune for
  him&mdash;but they could never find it in their heart to let him begin. I&rsquo;ve
  heard that many warned them, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id=
  "Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> wouldn&rsquo;t be warned. So it happened <i>as</i> it
  happened.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;One hot night I saw the Boy roving about here wrapped in his flaming
  discontents. There was flash on flash against the clouds, and rush on rush of shadows
  down the valley till the shaws were full of his hounds giving tongue, and the wood-ways
  were packed with his knights in armour riding down into the water-mists&mdash;all his
  own magic, of course. Behind them you could see great castles lifting slow and splendid
  on arches of moonshine, with maidens waving their hands at the windows, which all
  turned into roaring rivers; and then would come the darkness of his own young heart
  wiping out the whole slateful. But boy&rsquo;s magic doesn&rsquo;t trouble me&mdash;or
  Merlin&rsquo;s either for that matter. I followed the Boy by the flashes and the
  whirling wildfire of his discontent, and oh, but I grieved for him! Oh, but I grieved
  for him! He pounded back and forth like a bullock in a strange pasture&mdash;sometimes
  alone&mdash;sometimes waist-deep among his shadow-hounds&mdash;sometimes leading his
  shadow-knights on a hawk-winged horse to rescue his shadow-girls. I never guessed he
  had such magic at his command; but it&rsquo;s often that way with boys.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Just when the owl comes home for the second time, I saw Sir Huon and the Lady
  ride down my Hill, where there&rsquo;s not much magic allowed except mine. They were
  very pleased at the Boy&rsquo;s magic&mdash;the valley flared with it&mdash;and I heard
  them settling his splendid fortune when they should find it in their hearts to let him
  go to act and influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
  20]</a></span> among folk in housen. Sir Huon was for making him a great King somewhere
  or other, and the Lady was for making him a marvellous wise man whom all should praise
  for his skill and kindness. She was very kind-hearted.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Of a sudden we saw the flashes of his discontent turned back on the clouds,
  and his shadow-hounds stopped baying.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Magic fighting Magic over yonder,&rdquo; the Lady
  Esclairmonde cried, reining up. &ldquo;Who is against him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I could have told her, but I did not count it any of my business to speak of
  Asa Thor&rsquo;s comings and goings.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How did you know?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A slow North-East wind blew up, sawing and fretting through the oaks in a way
  I remembered. The wildfire roared up, one last time in one sheet, and snuffed out like
  a rush-light, and a bucketful of stinging hail fell. We heard the Boy walking in the
  Long Slip&mdash;where I first met you.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Here, oh, come here!&rdquo; said the Lady Esclairmonde, and stretched
  out her arms in the dark.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He was coming slowly, but he stumbled in the footpath, being, of course,
  mortal man.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said to himself. We three heard
  him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hold, lad, hold! &rsquo;Ware Cold Iron!&rdquo; said Sir Huon, and they
  two swept down like night-jars, crying as they rode.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I ran at their stirrups, but it was too late. We felt that the Boy had
  touched Cold Iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
  21]</a></span> somewhere in the dark, for the Horses of the Hill shied off, and whipped
  round, snorting.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then I judged it was time for me to show myself in my own shape; so I
  did.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he has taken hold of it. Now we
  must find out whatever it <i>is</i> that he has taken hold of; for that will be his
  fortune.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Come here, Robin,&rdquo; the Boy shouted, as soon as he heard my
  voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve hold of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It is in your hands,&rdquo; I called back. &ldquo;Tell us if it is
  hard and cold, with jewels atop. For that will be a King&rsquo;s Sceptre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not by a furrow-long,&rdquo; he said, and stooped and tugged in the
  dark. We heard him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Has it a handle and two cutting edges?&rdquo; I called. &ldquo;For
  that&rsquo;ll be a Knight&rsquo;s Sword.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, it hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s neither
  ploughshare, whittle, hook, nor crook, nor aught I&rsquo;ve yet seen men handle.&rdquo;
  By this time he was scratting in the dirt to prize it up.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Whatever it is, you know who put it there, Robin,&rdquo; said Sir Huon
  to me, &ldquo;or you would not ask those questions. You should have told me as soon as
  you knew.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What could you or I have done against the Smith that made it and laid
  it for him to find?&rdquo; I said, and I whispered Sir Huon what I had seen at the
  Forge on Thor&rsquo;s Day, when the babe was first brought to the Hill.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, good-bye, our dreams!&rdquo; said Sir Huon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  neither sceptre, sword, nor plough! Maybe yet it&rsquo;s a bookful of learning, bound
  with iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
  clasps. There&rsquo;s a chance for a splendid fortune in that sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But we knew we were only speaking to comfort ourselves, and the Lady
  Esclairmonde, having been a woman, said so.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Thur aie! Thur help us!&rdquo; the Boy called. &ldquo;It is round,
  without end, Cold Iron, four fingers wide and a thumb thick, and there is writing on
  the breadth of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Read the writing if you have the learning,&rdquo; I called. The
  darkness had lifted by then, and the owl was out over the fern again.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He called back, reading the runes on the iron:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <span class="i6">&ldquo;Few can see</span><br />
    <span class="i6">Further forth</span><br />
    <span class="i6">Than when the child</span><br />
    <span class="i6">Meets the Cold Iron.&rdquo;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>And there he stood, in clear starlight, with a new, heavy, shining slave-ring round
  his proud neck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Is this how it goes?&rdquo; he asked, while the Lady Esclairmonde
  cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That is how it goes,&rdquo; I said. He hadn&rsquo;t snapped the catch
  home yet, though.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What fortune does it mean for him?&rdquo; said Sir Huon, while the Boy
  fingered the ring. &ldquo;You who walk under Cold Iron, you must tell us and teach
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Tell I can, but teach I cannot,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The virtue of
  the Ring is only that he must go among folk in housen henceforward, doing what they
  want done, or what he knows they need, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id=
  "Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Old England over. Never will he be his own master, nor yet
  ever any man&rsquo;s. He will get half he gives, and give twice what he gets, till his
  life&rsquo;s last breath; and if he lays aside his load before he draws that last
  breath, all his work will go for naught.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, cruel, wicked Thor!&rdquo; cried the Lady Esclairmonde. &ldquo;Ah,
  look, see, all of you! The catch is still open! He hasn&rsquo;t locked it. He can still
  take it off. He can still come back. Come back!&rdquo; She went as near as she dared,
  but she could not lay hands on Cold Iron. The Boy could have taken it off, yes. We
  waited to see if he would, but he put up his hand, and the snap locked home.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What else could I have done?&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Surely,then, you will do,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Morning&rsquo;s
  coming, and if you three have any farewells to make, make them now, for, after sunrise,
  Cold Iron must be your master.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So the three sat down, cheek by wet cheek, telling over their farewells till
  morning light. As good a boy as ever lived, he was.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And what happened to him?&rsquo; asked Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When morning came, Cold Iron was master of him and his fortune, and he went
  to work among folk in housen. Presently he came across a maid like-minded with himself,
  and they were wedded, and had bushels of children, as the saying is. Perhaps
  you&rsquo;ll meet some of his breed, this year.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;But what did the poor Lady Esclairmonde
  do?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;What <i>can</i> you do when Asa Thor lays the Cold Iron in a lad&rsquo;s
  path? She and Sir Huon were comforted to think they had given the Boy good store of
  learning to act and influence on folk in housen. For he <i>was</i> a good boy!
  Isn&rsquo;t it getting on for breakfast time? I&rsquo;ll walk with you a
  piece.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>When they were well in the centre of the bone-dry fern, Dan nudged Una, who stopped
  and put on a boot as quickly as she could.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t get any Oak, Ash, and Thorn
  leaves from here, and&rsquo;&mdash;she balanced wildly on one
  leg&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m standing on Cold Iron. What&rsquo;ll you do if we
  don&rsquo;t go away?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;E-eh? Of all mortal impudence!&rsquo; said Puck, as Dan, also in one boot,
  grabbed his sister&rsquo;s hand to steady himself. He walked round them, shaking with
  delight. &lsquo;You think I can only work with a handful of dead leaves? This comes of
  taking away your Doubt and Fear! I&rsquo;ll show you!&rsquo;</p>
  <hr style="width: 45%;" />

  <p>A minute later they charged into old Hobden at his simple breakfast of cold roast
  pheasant, shouting that there was a wasps&rsquo; nest in the fern which they had nearly
  stepped on, and asking him to come and smoke it out.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too early for wops-nestes, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t go
  diggin&rsquo; in the Hill, not for shillin&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said the old man placidly.
  &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve a thorn in your foot, Miss Una. Sit down, and put on your
  t&rsquo;other boot. You&rsquo;re too old to be caperin&rsquo; barefoot on an empty
  stomach. Stay it with this chicken o&rsquo; mine.&rsquo;</p>

  <h2 class="sectionhead">Gloriana</h2>

  <p>Willow Shaw, the little fenced wood where the hop-poles are stacked like Indian
  wigwams, had been given to Dan and Una for their very own kingdom when they were quite
  small. As they grew older, they contrived to keep it most particularly private. Even
  Phillips, the gardener, told them every time he came in to take a hop-pole for his
  beans, and old Hobden would no more have thought of setting his rabbit-wires there
  without leave, given fresh each spring, than he would have torn down the calico and
  marking-ink notice on the big willow which said: &lsquo;Grown-ups not allowed in the
  Kingdom unless brought.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Now you can understand their indignation when, one blowy July afternoon, as they
  were going up for a potato-roast, they saw somebody moving among the trees. They hurled
  themselves over the gate, dropping half the potatoes, and while they were picking them
  up Puck came out of a wigwam.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;We thought it was
  people.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
  32]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I saw you were angry&mdash;from your legs,&rsquo; he answered with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s our own Kingdom&mdash;not counting you, of
  course.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s rather why I came. A lady here wants to see you.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What about?&rsquo; said Dan cautiously.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, just Kingdoms and things. She knows about Kingdoms.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>There was a lady near the fence dressed in a long dark cloak that hid everything
  except her high red-heeled shoes. Her face was half covered by a black silk fringed
  mask, without goggles. And yet she did not look in the least as if she motored.</p>

  <p>Puck led them up to her and bowed solemnly. Una made the best dancing-lesson curtsy
  she could remember. The lady answered with a long, deep, slow, billowy one.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Since it seems that you are a Queen of this Kingdom,&rsquo; she said,
  &lsquo;I can do no less than acknowledge your sovereignty.&rsquo; She turned sharply on
  staring Dan. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s in your head, lad? Manners?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was thinking how wonderfully you did that curtsy,&rsquo; he answered.</p>

  <p>She laughed a rather shrill laugh. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a courtier already. Do you
  know anything of dances, wench&mdash;or Queen, must I say?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had some lessons, but I can&rsquo;t really dance a bit,&rsquo;
  said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You should learn then.&rsquo; The lady moved forward as though she would
  teach her at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
  33]</a></span>&lsquo;It gives a woman alone among men or her enemies time to think how
  she shall win or&mdash;lose. A woman can only work in man&rsquo;s playtime.
  Heigho!&rsquo; She sat down on the bank.</p>

  <p>Old Middenboro, the lawn-mower pony, stumped across the paddock and hung his
  sorrowful head over the fence.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A pleasant Kingdom,&rsquo; said the lady, looking round. &lsquo;Well
  enclosed. And how does your Majesty govern it? Who is your Minister?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Una did not quite understand. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t play that,&rsquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Play?&rsquo; The lady threw up her hands and laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We have it for our own, together,&rsquo; Dan explained.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And d&rsquo;you never quarrel, young Burleigh?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Sometimes, but then we don&rsquo;t tell.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The lady nodded. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no brats of my own, but I understand keeping a
  secret between Queens and their Ministers. <i>Ay de mi!</i> But with no disrespect to
  present majesty, methinks your realm is small, and therefore likely to be coveted by
  man and beast. For example&rsquo;&mdash;she pointed to Middenboro&mdash;&lsquo;yonder
  old horse, with the face of a Spanish friar&mdash;does he never break in?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He can&rsquo;t. Old Hobden stops all our gaps for us,&rsquo; said Una,
  &lsquo;and we let Hobden catch rabbits in the Shaw.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The lady laughed like a man. &lsquo;I see! Hobden catches
  conies&mdash;rabbits&mdash;for himself, and guards your defences for you. Does he make
  a profit out of his coney-catching?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id=
  "Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;We never ask,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Hobden&rsquo;s a particular friend of
  ours.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hoity-toity!&rsquo; the lady began angrily. Then she laughed. &lsquo;But I
  forget. It is your Kingdom. I knew a maid once that had a larger one than this to
  defend, and so long as her men kept the fences stopped, she asked &rsquo;em no
  questions either.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Was she trying to grow flowers?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, trees&mdash;perdurable trees. Her flowers all withered.&rsquo; The lady
  leaned her head on her hand.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They do if you don&rsquo;t look after them. We&rsquo;ve got a few. Would you
  like to see? I&rsquo;ll fetch you some.&rsquo; Una ran off to the rank grass in the
  shade behind the wigwam, and came back with a handful of red flowers.
  &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t they pretty?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re Virginia
  stock.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Virginia?&rsquo; said the lady, and lifted them to the fringe of her
  mask.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes. They come from Virginia. Did your maid ever plant any?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not herself&mdash;but her men adventured all over the earth to pluck or to
  plant flowers for her crown. They judged her worthy of them.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And was she?&rsquo; said Dan cheerfully.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> (who knows?) But at least, while her men toiled abroad she
  toiled in England, that they might find a safe home to come back to.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And what was she called?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Gloriana&mdash;Belph&oelig;be&mdash;Elizabeth of England.&rsquo; Her voice
  changed at each word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
  35]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;You mean Queen Bess?&rsquo; The lady bowed her head a little towards Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You name her lightly enough, young Burleigh. What might you know of
  her?&rsquo; said she.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen the little green shoes she left at Brickwall
  House&mdash;down the road, you know. They&rsquo;re in a glass case&mdash;awfully tiny
  things.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Burleigh, Burleigh!&rsquo; she laughed. &lsquo;You are a courtier too
  soon.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But they are,&rsquo; Dan insisted. &lsquo;As little as dolls&rsquo; shoes.
  Did you really know her well?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well. She was a&mdash;woman. I&rsquo;ve been at her Court all my life. Yes, I
  remember when she danced after the banquet at Brickwall. They say she danced Philip of
  Spain out of a brand-new kingdom that day. Worth the price of a pair of old
  shoes&mdash;hey?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She thrust out one foot, and stooped forward to look at its broad flashing
  buckle.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of Philip of Spain&mdash;long-suffering Philip,&rsquo; she
  said, her eyes still on the shining stones. &lsquo;Faith, what some men will endure at
  some women&rsquo;s hands passes belief! If <i>I</i> had been a man, and a woman had
  played with me as Elizabeth played with Philip, I would have&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; She
  nipped off one of the Virginia stocks and held it up between finger and thumb.
  &lsquo;But for all that&rsquo;&mdash;she began to strip the leaves one by
  one&mdash;&rsquo;they say&mdash;and I am persuaded&mdash;that Philip loved her.&rsquo;
  She tossed her head sideways.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The high heavens forbid that you should, wench!&rsquo; She swept the flowers
  from her lap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
  stood up in the rush of shadows that the wind chased through the wood.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I should like to know about the shoes,&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So ye shall, Burleigh. So ye shall, if ye watch me. &lsquo;Twill be as good
  as a play.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve never been to a play,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>The lady looked at her and laughed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make one for you. Watch! You
  are to imagine that she&mdash;Gloriana, Belph&oelig;be, Elizabeth&mdash;has gone on a
  progress to Rye to comfort her sad heart (maids are often melancholic), and while she
  halts at Brickwall House, the village&mdash;what was its name?&rsquo; She pushed Puck
  with her foot.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Norgem,&rsquo; he croaked, and squatted by the wigwam.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Norgem village loyally entertains her with a masque or play, and a Latin
  oration spoken by the parson, for whose false quantities, if I&rsquo;d made &rsquo;em
  in my girlhood, I should have been whipped.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You whipped?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Soundly, sirrah, soundly! She stomachs the affront to her scholarship, makes
  her grateful, gracious thanks from the teeth outwards, thus&rsquo;&mdash;(the lady
  yawned)&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, a Queen may love her subjects in her heart, and yet be
  dog-wearied of &rsquo;em in body and mind&mdash;and so sits down&rsquo;&mdash;her
  skirts foamed about her as she sat&mdash;&rsquo;to a banquet beneath Brickwall Oak.
  Here for her sins she is waited upon by&mdash;&mdash; What were the young
  cockerels&rsquo; names that served Gloriana at table?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Frewens, Courthopes, Fullers, Husseys,&rsquo; Puck began.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

  <p>She held up her long jewelled hand. &lsquo;Spare the rest! They were the best blood
  of Sussex, and by so much the more clumsy in handling the dishes and plates.
  Wherefore&rsquo;&mdash;she looked funnily over her shoulder&mdash;&lsquo;you are to
  think of Gloriana in a green and gold-laced habit, dreadfully expecting that the
  jostling youths behind her would, of pure jealousy or devotion, spatter it with sauces
  and wines. The gown was Philip&rsquo;s gift, too! At this happy juncture a
  Queen&rsquo;s messenger, mounted and mired, spurs up the Rye road and delivers her a
  letter&rsquo;&mdash;she giggled&mdash;&lsquo;a letter from a good, simple, frantic
  Spanish gentleman called&mdash;Don Philip.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That wasn&rsquo;t Philip, King of Spain?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Truly, it was. &lsquo;Twixt you and me and the bedpost, young Burleigh, these
  kings and queens are very like men and women, and I&rsquo;ve heard they write each
  other fond, foolish letters that none of their ministers should open.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Did her ministers ever open Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s letters?&rsquo; said
  Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Faith, yes! But she&rsquo;d have done as much for theirs, any day. You are to
  think of Gloriana, then (they say she had a pretty hand), excusing herself thus to the
  company&mdash;for the Queen&rsquo;s time is never her own&mdash;and, while the music
  strikes up, reading Philip&rsquo;s letter, as I do.&rsquo; She drew a real letter from
  her pocket, and held it out almost at arm&rsquo;s length, like the old post-mistress in
  the village when she reads telegrams.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>Hm! Hm! Hm!</i> Philip writes as ever most lovingly. He says his Gloriana
  is cold, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg
  38]</a></span> reason he burns for her through a fair written page.&rsquo; She turned
  it with a snap. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s here? Philip complains that certain of her
  gentlemen have fought against his generals in the Low Countries. He prays her to hang
  &rsquo;em when they re-enter her realms. (Hm, that&rsquo;s as may be.) Here&rsquo;s a
  list of burnt shipping slipped between two vows of burning adoration. Oh, poor Philip!
  His admirals at sea&mdash;no less than three of &rsquo;em&mdash;have been boarded,
  sacked, and scuttled on their lawful voyages by certain English mariners (gentlemen, he
  will not call them), who are now at large and working more piracies in <i>his</i>
  American ocean, which the Pope gave him. (He and the Pope should guard it, then!)
  Philip hears, but his devout ears will not credit it, that Gloriana in some fashion
  countenances these villains&rsquo; misdeeds, shares in their booty, and&mdash;oh,
  shame!&mdash;has even lent them ships royal for their sinful thefts. Therefore he
  requires (which is a word Gloriana loves not), <i>requires</i> that she shall hang
  &rsquo;em when they return to England, and afterwards shall account to him for all the
  goods and gold they have plundered. A most loving request! If Gloriana will not be
  Philip&rsquo;s bride, she shall be his broker and his butcher! Should she still be
  stiff-necked, he writes&mdash;see where the pen digged the innocent paper!&mdash;that
  he hath both the means and the intention to be revenged on her. Aha! Now we come to the
  Spaniard in his shirt!&rsquo; (She waved the letter merrily.) &lsquo;Listen here!
  Philip will prepare for Gloriana a destruction from the West&mdash;a destruction
  from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> the
  West&mdash;far exceeding that which Pedro de Avila wrought upon the Huguenots. And he
  rests and remains, kissing her feet and her hands, her slave, her enemy, or her
  conqueror, as he shall find that she uses him.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She thrust back the letter under her cloak, and went on acting, but in a softer
  voice. &lsquo;All this while&mdash;hark to it&mdash;the wind blows through Brickwall
  Oak, the music plays, and, with the company&rsquo;s eyes upon her, the Queen of England
  must think what this means. She cannot remember the name of Pedro de Avila, nor what he
  did to the Huguenots, nor when, nor where. She can only see darkly some dark motion
  moving in Philip&rsquo;s dark mind, for he hath never written before in this fashion.
  She must smile above the letter as though it were good news from her
  ministers&mdash;the smile that tires the mouth and the poor heart. What shall she
  do?&rsquo; Again her voice changed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You are to fancy that the music of a sudden wavers away. Chris Hatton,
  Captain of her bodyguard, quits the table all red and ruffled, and Gloriana&rsquo;s
  virgin ear catches the clash of swords at work behind a wall. The mothers of Sussex
  look round to count their chicks&mdash;I mean those young game-cocks that waited on
  her. Two dainty youths have stepped aside into Brickwall garden with rapier and dagger
  on a private point of honour. They are haled out through the gate, disarmed and
  glaring&mdash;the lively image of a brace of young Cupids transformed into pale,
  panting Cains. Ahem! Gloriana beckons awfully&mdash;thus!<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> They come up for judgment. Their lives and
  estates lie at her mercy whom they have doubly offended, both as Queen and woman. But
  la! what will not foolish young men do for a beautiful maid?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why? What did she do? What had they done?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hsh! You mar the play! Gloriana had guessed the cause of the trouble. They
  were handsome lads. So she frowns a while and tells &rsquo;em not to be bigger fools
  than their mothers had made &rsquo;em, and warns &rsquo;em, if they do not kiss and be
  friends on the instant, she&rsquo;ll have Chris Hatton horse and birch &rsquo;em in the
  style of the new school at Harrow. (Chris looks sour at that.) Lastly, because she
  needed time to think on Philip&rsquo;s letter burning in her pocket, she signifies her
  pleasure to dance with &rsquo;em and teach &rsquo;em better manners. Whereat the
  revived company call down Heaven&rsquo;s blessing on her gracious head; Chris and the
  others prepare Brickwall House for a dance, and she walks in the clipped garden between
  those two lovely young sinners who are both ready to sink for shame. They confess their
  fault. It appears that midway in the banquet the elder&mdash;they were
  cousins&mdash;conceived that the Queen looked upon him with special favour. The
  younger, taking the look to himself, after some words gives the elder the lie; hence,
  as she guessed, the duel.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And which had she really looked at?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
    <a href="images/i001.jpg"><img src="images/i001.jpg" width="411" height="600" id=

    <b>&lsquo;Admiral Boy--Vice Admiral Babe,&rsquo; says Gloriana, &lsquo;I cry your pardon.&rsquo;--p. 41</b>
  </div>

  <p>&lsquo;Neither&mdash;except to wish them farther off. She was afraid all the while
  they&rsquo;d spill dishes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
  41]</a></span> her gown. She tells &rsquo;em this, poor chicks&mdash;and it completes
  their abasement. When they had grilled long enough, she says: &ldquo;And so you would
  have fleshed your maiden swords for me&mdash;for me?" Faith, they would have been at it
  again if she&rsquo;d egged &rsquo;em on! but their swords&mdash;oh, prettily they said
  it!&mdash;had been drawn for her once or twice already.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And where?&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;On your hobby-horses before you
  were breeched?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;On my own ship,&rdquo; says the elder. &ldquo;My cousin was
  vice-admiral of our venture in his pinnace. We would not have you think of us as
  brawling children.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says the younger, and flames like a very Tudor rose.
  &ldquo;At least the Spaniards know us better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Admiral Boy&mdash;Vice-Admiral Babe,&rdquo; says Gloriana, &ldquo;I
  cry your pardon. The heat of these present times ripens childhood to age more quickly
  than I can follow. But we are at peace with Spain. Where did you break your
  Queen&rsquo;s peace?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;On the sea called the Spanish Main, though &rsquo;tis no more Spanish
  than my doublet,&rdquo; says the elder. Guess how that warmed Gloriana&rsquo;s already
  melting heart! She would never suffer any sea to be called Spanish in her private
  hearing.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And why was I not told? What booty got you, and where have you hid it?
  Disclose,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;You stand in some danger of the gallows for
  pirates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The axe, most gracious lady,&rdquo; says the<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> elder, &ldquo;for we are
  gentle born.&rdquo; He spoke truth, but no woman can brook contradiction.
  "Hoity-toity,&rdquo; says she, and, but that she remembered that she was a Queen,
  she&rsquo;d have cuffed the pair of &rsquo;em. &ldquo;It shall be gallows, hurdle, and
  dung-cart if I choose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Had our Queen known of our going beforehand, Philip might have held
  her to blame for some small things we did on the seas,&rdquo; the younger lisps.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;As for treasure,&rdquo; says the elder, &ldquo;we brought back but our
  bare lives. We were wrecked on the Gascons&rsquo; Graveyard, where our sole company for
  three months was the bleached bones of De Avila&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Gloriana&rsquo;s mind jumped back to Philip&rsquo;s last letter.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;De Avila that destroyed the Huguenots? What d&rsquo;dou know of
  him?&rdquo; she says. The music called from the house here, and they three turned back
  between the yews.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Simply that De Avila broke in upon a plantation of Frenchmen on that
  coast, and very Spaniardly hung them all for heretics&mdash;eight hundred or so. The
  next year Dominique de Gorgues, a Gascon, broke in upon De Avila&rsquo;s men, and very
  justly hung &rsquo;em all for murderers&mdash;five hundred or so. No Christians inhabit
  there now,&rdquo; says the elder lad, &ldquo;though &rsquo;tis a goodly land north of
  Florida.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How far is it from England?&rdquo; asks prudent Gloriana.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;With a fair wind, six weeks. They say<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> that Philip will plant it again soon.&rdquo;
  This was the younger, and he looked at her out of the corner of his innocent eye.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Chris Hatton, fuming, meets and leads her into Brickwall Hall, where she
  dances&mdash;thus. A woman can think while she dances&mdash;can think. I&rsquo;ll show
  you. Watch!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She took off her cloak slowly, and stood forth in dove-coloured satin, worked over
  with pearls that trembled like running water in the running shadows of the trees. Still
  talking&mdash;more to herself than to the children&mdash;she swam into a majestical
  dance of the stateliest balancings, the haughtiest wheelings and turnings aside, the
  most dignified sinkings, the gravest risings, all joined together by the elaboratest
  interlacing steps and circles.</p>

  <p>They leaned forward breathlessly to watch the splendid acting.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Would a Spaniard,&rsquo; she began, looking on the ground, &lsquo;speak of
  his revenge till his revenge were ripe? No. Yet a man who loved a woman might threaten
  her in the hope that his threats would make her love him. Such things have been.&rsquo;
  She moved slowly across a bar of sunlight. &lsquo;A destruction from the West may
  signify that Philip means to descend on Ireland. But then my Irish spies would have had
  some warning. The Irish keep no secrets. No&mdash;it is not Ireland. Now
  why&mdash;why&mdash;why&rsquo;&mdash;the red shoes clicked and paused&mdash;&lsquo;does
  Philip name Pedro Melendez de Avila, a general in his Americas, unless&rsquo;&mdash;she
  turned more quickly&mdash;&lsquo;unless he intends to<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> work his destruction from the Americas? Did
  he say De Avila only to put her off her guard, or for this once has his black pen
  betrayed his black heart? We&rsquo;&mdash;she raised herself to her full
  height&mdash;&lsquo;England must forestall Master Philip. But not openly,&rsquo; she
  sank again&mdash;&lsquo;we cannot fight Spain openly&mdash;not yet&mdash;not
  yet.&rsquo; She stepped three paces as though she were pegging down some snare with her
  twinkling shoe-buckles. &lsquo;The Queen&rsquo;s mad gentlemen may fight Philip&rsquo;s
  poor admirals where they find &rsquo;em, but England, Gloriana, Harry&rsquo;s daughter,
  must keep the peace. Perhaps, after all, Philip loves her&mdash;as many men and boys
  do. That may help England. Oh, <i>what</i> shall help England?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her head&mdash;the masked head that seemed to have nothing to do with the
  busy feet&mdash;and stared straight at the children.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I think this is rather creepy,&rsquo; said Una with a shiver. &lsquo;I wish
  she&rsquo;d stop.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The lady held out her jewelled hand as though she were taking some one else&rsquo;s
  hand in the Grand Chain.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Can a ship go down into the Gascons&rsquo; Graveyard and wait there?&rsquo;
  she asked into the air, and passed on rustling.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s pretending to ask one of the cousins, isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;
  said Dan, and Puck nodded.</p>

  <p>Back she came in the silent, swaying, ghostly dance. They saw she was smiling
  beneath the mask, and they could hear her breathing hard.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I cannot lend you any my ships for the venture; Philip would hear of
  it,&rsquo; she whispered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
  45]</a></span> her shoulder; &lsquo;but as much guns and powder as you ask, if you do
  not ask too&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; her voice shot up and she stamped her foot thrice.
  &lsquo;Louder! Louder, the music in the gallery! Oh, me, but I have burst out of my
  shoe!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She gathered her skirts in each hand, and began a curtsy. &lsquo;You will go at your
  own charges,&rsquo; she whispered straight before her. &lsquo;Oh, enviable and adorable
  age of youth!&rsquo; Her eyes shone through the mask-holes. &lsquo;But I warn you
  you&rsquo;ll repent it. Put not your trust in princes&mdash;or Queens. Philip&rsquo;s
  ships&rsquo;ll blow you out of water. You&rsquo;ll not be frightened? Well, we&rsquo;ll
  talk on it again, when I return from Rye, dear lads.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The wonderful curtsy ended. She stood up. Nothing stirred on her except the rush of
  the shadows.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And so it was finished,&rsquo; she said to the children. &lsquo;Why
  d&rsquo;you not applaud?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What was finished?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The dance,&rsquo; the lady replied offendedly. &lsquo;And a pair of green
  shoes.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand a bit,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Eh? What did <i>you</i> make of it, young Burleigh?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure,&rsquo; Dan began,
  &lsquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You never can be&mdash;with a woman. But&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But I thought Gloriana meant the cousins to go back to the Gascons&rsquo;
  Graveyard, wherever that was.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas Virginia afterwards. Her plantation of
  Virginia.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
  46]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Virginia afterwards, and stop Philip from taking it. Didn&rsquo;t she say
  she&rsquo;d lend &rsquo;em guns?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Right so. But not ships&mdash;<i>then</i>.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And I thought you meant they must have told her they&rsquo;d do it off their
  own bat, without getting her into a row with Philip. Was I right?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Near enough for a Minister of the Queen. But remember she gave the lads full
  time to change their minds. She was three long days at Rye Royal&mdash;knighting of fat
  Mayors. When she came back to Brickwall, they met her a mile down the road, and she
  could feel their eyes burn through her riding-mask. Chris Hatton, poor fool, was vexed
  at it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You would not birch them when I gave you the chance,&rdquo; says she
  to Chris. &ldquo;Now you must get me half an hour&rsquo;s private speech with &rsquo;em
  in Brickwall garden. Eve tempted Adam in a garden. Quick, man, or I may
  repent!"&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She was a Queen. Why did she not send for them herself,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>The lady shook her head. &lsquo;That was never her way. I&rsquo;ve seen her walk to
  her own mirror by bye-ends, and the woman that cannot walk straight <i>there</i> is
  past praying for. Yet I would have you pray for her! What else&mdash;what else in
  England&rsquo;s name could she have done?&rsquo; She lifted her hand to her throat for
  a moment. &lsquo;Faith,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten the little green
  shoes! She left &rsquo;em at Brickwall&mdash;so she did. And I remember she gave the
  Norgem parson&mdash;John Withers, was he?&mdash;a text for his sermon&mdash;"Over Edom
  have I cast out my shoe.&rdquo; Neat, if he&rsquo;d understood!&rsquo;<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;What about the two
  cousins?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You are as cruel as a woman,&rsquo; the lady answered. &lsquo;<i>I</i> was
  not to blame. I told you I gave &rsquo;em time to change their minds. On my honour
  (<i>ay de mi!</i>), she asked no more of &rsquo;em at first than to wait a while off
  that coast&mdash;the Gascons&rsquo; Graveyard&mdash;to hover a little if their ships
  chanced to pass that way&mdash;they had only one tall ship and a pinnace&mdash;only to
  watch and bring me word of Philip&rsquo;s doings. One must watch Philip always. What a
  murrain right had he to make any plantation there, a hundred leagues north of his
  Spanish Main, and only six weeks from England? By my dread father&rsquo;s soul, I tell
  you he had none&mdash;none!&rsquo; She stamped her red foot again, and the two children
  shrunk back for a second.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Nay, nay. You must not turn from me too! She laid it all fairly before the
  lads in Brickwall garden between the yews. I told &rsquo;em that if Philip sent a fleet
  (and to make a plantation he could not well send less), their poor little cock-boats
  could not sink it. They answered that, with submission, the fight would be their own
  concern. She showed &rsquo;em again that there could be only one end to it&mdash;quick
  death on the sea, or slow death in Philip&rsquo;s prisons. They asked no more than to
  embrace death for my sake. Many men have prayed to me for life. I&rsquo;ve refused
  &rsquo;em, and slept none the worse after; but when my men, my tall, fantastical young
  men beseech me on their knees for leave to die for me, it shakes<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> me&mdash;ah, it shakes me
  to the marrow of my old bones.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Her chest sounded like a board as she hit it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She showed &rsquo;em all. I told &rsquo;em that this was no time for open war
  with Spain. If by miracle inconceivable they prevailed against Philip&rsquo;s fleet,
  Philip would hold me accountable. For England&rsquo;s sake, to save war, I should
  e&rsquo;en be forced (I told &rsquo;em so) to give him up their young lives. If they
  failed, and again by some miracle escaped Philip&rsquo;s hand, and crept back to
  England with their bare lives, they must lie&mdash;oh, I told &rsquo;em all&mdash;under
  my sovereign displeasure. She could not know them, see them, nor hear their names, nor
  stretch out a finger to save them from the gallows, if Philip chose to ask it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Be it the gallows, then,&rdquo; says the elder. (I could have wept,
  but that my face was made for the day.)</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Either way&mdash;any way&mdash;this venture is death, which I know you
  fear not. But it is death with assured dishonour,&rdquo; I cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yet our Queen will know in her heart what we have done,&rdquo; says
  the younger.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A queen has no heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But she is a woman, and a woman would not forget,&rdquo; says the
  elder. &ldquo;We will go!&rdquo; They knelt at my feet.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nay, dear lads&mdash;but here!&rdquo; I said, and I opened my arms to
  them and I kissed them.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Be ruled by me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hire some
  ill-featured old tarry-breeks of an admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id=
  "Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> to watch the Graveyard, and you shall come to Court."</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hire whom you please,&rdquo; says the elder; &ldquo;we are ruled by
  you, body and soul"; and the younger, who shook most when I kissed &rsquo;em, says
  between his white lips, &ldquo;I think you have power to make a god of a man."</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Come to Court and be sure of it,&rdquo; I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They shook their heads and I knew&mdash;I knew, that go they would. If I had
  not kissed them&mdash;perhaps I might have prevailed.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then why did you do it?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you knew
  really what you wanted done.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;May it please your Majesty,&rsquo; the lady bowed her head low, &lsquo;this
  Gloriana whom I have represented for your pleasure was a woman and a Queen. Remember
  her when you come to your kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But did the cousins go to the Gascons&rsquo; Graveyard?&rsquo; said Dan, as
  Una frowned.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They went,&rsquo; said the lady.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Did they ever come back?&rsquo; Una began; but&mdash;&lsquo;Did they stop
  <ins class="correction" title="original: King Philip&rsquo;s fleet!">King
  Philip&rsquo;s fleet?</ins>&rsquo; Dan interrupted.</p>

  <p>The lady turned to him eagerly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;you think they did right to go?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see what else they could have done,&rsquo; Dan replied, after
  thinking it over.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;you think she did right to send &rsquo;em?&rsquo; The lady&rsquo;s
  voice rose a little.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Dan, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see what else she could have
  done, either&mdash;do you? How did they stop King Philip from getting
  Virginia?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
  50]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the sad part of it. They sailed out that autumn from Rye Royal,
  and there never came back so much as a single rope-yarn to show what had befallen them.
  The winds blew, and they were not. Does that make you alter your mind, young
  Burleigh?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I expect they were drowned, then. Anyhow, Philip didn&rsquo;t score, did
  he?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Gloriana wiped out her score with Philip later. But if Philip had won, would
  you have blamed Gloriana for wasting those lads&rsquo; lives?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Of course not. She was bound to try to stop him.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The lady coughed. &lsquo;You have the root of the matter in you. Were I Queen,
  I&rsquo;d make you Minister.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t play that game,&rsquo; said Una, who felt that she disliked
  the lady as much as she disliked the noise the high wind made tearing through Willow
  Shaw.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Play!&rsquo; said the lady with a laugh, and threw up her hands affectedly.
  The sunshine caught the jewels on her many rings and made them flash till Una&rsquo;s
  eyes dazzled, and she had to rub them. Then she saw Dan on his knees picking up the
  potatoes they had spilled at the gate.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anybody in the Shaw, after all,&rsquo; he said.
  &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think you saw some one?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m most awfully glad there isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Una. Then they
  went on with the potato-roast.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_The_Wrong_Thing" id="CHAPTER_The_Wrong_Thing"></a>The Wrong
  Thing</h2>

  <p>Dan had gone in for building model boats; but after he had filled the schoolroom
  with chips, which he expected Una to clear away, they turned him out of doors and he
  took all his tools up the hill to Mr. Springett&rsquo;s yard, where he knew he could
  make as much mess as he chose. Old Mr. Springett was a builder, contractor, and
  sanitary engineer, and his yard, which opened off the village street, was always full
  of interesting things. At one end of it was a long loft, reached by a ladder, where he
  kept his iron-bound scaffold planks, tins of paints, pulleys, and odds and ends he had
  found in old houses. He would sit here by the hour watching his carts as they loaded or
  unloaded in the yard below, while Dan gouged and grunted at the carpenter&rsquo;s bench
  near the loft window. Mr. Springett and Dan had always been particular friends, for Mr.
  Springett was so old he could remember when railways were being made in the southern
  counties of England, and people were allowed to drive dogs in carts.</p>

  <p>One hot, still afternoon&mdash;the tar-paper on the roof smelt like ships&mdash;Dan,
  in his shirt sleeves, was smoothing down a new schooner&rsquo;s bow, and<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> Mr. Springett was talking
  of barns and houses he had built. He said he never forgot any stick or stone he had
  ever handled, or any man, woman, or child he had ever met. Just then he was very proud
  of the village Hall at the entrance to the village, which he had finished a few weeks
  before.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; you, Mus&rsquo; Dan,&rsquo; he
  said, &lsquo;that the Hall will be my last job top of this mortal earth. I didn&rsquo;t
  make ten pounds&mdash;no, nor yet five&mdash;out o&rsquo; the whole contrac&rsquo;, but
  my name&rsquo;s lettered on the foundation stone&mdash;<i>Ralph Springett,
  Builder</i>&mdash;and the stone she&rsquo;s bedded on four foot good concrete. If she
  shifts any time these five hundred years, I&rsquo;ll sure-ly turn in my grave. I told
  the Lunnon architec&rsquo; so when he come down to oversee my work.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; Dan was sandpapering the schooner&rsquo;s port
  bow.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Nothing. The Hall ain&rsquo;t more than one of his small jobs for <i>him</i>,
  but &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t small to me, an&rsquo; my name is cut and lettered,
  frontin&rsquo; the village street, I do hope an&rsquo; pray, for time
  everlastin.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll want the little round file for that holler in her bow.
  Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; Mr. Springett turned stiffly in his chair.</p>

  <p>A long pile of scaffold-planks ran down the centre of the loft. Dan looked, and saw
  Hal of the Draft&rsquo;s touzled head beyond them.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
  "FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Be you the builder of the village Hall?&rsquo; he asked of Mr. Springett.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I be,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;But if you want a
  job&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
  59]</a></span></p>

  <p>Hal laughed. &lsquo;No, faith!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Only the Hall is as good and
  honest a piece of work as I&rsquo;ve ever run a rule over. So, being born hereabouts,
  and being reckoned a master among masons, and accepted as a master mason, I made bold
  to pay my brotherly respects to the builder.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Aa&mdash;um!&rsquo; Mr. Springett looked important. &lsquo;I be a bit rusty,
  but I&rsquo;ll try ye!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He asked Hal several curious questions, and the answers must have pleased him, for
  he invited Hal to sit down. Hal moved up, always keeping behind the pile of planks so
  that only his head showed, and sat down on a trestle in the dark corner at the back of
  Mr. Springett&rsquo;s desk. He took no notice of Dan, but talked at once to Mr.
  Springett about bricks, and cement, and lead and glass, and after a while Dan went on
  with his work. He knew Mr. Springett was pleased, because he tugged his white sandy
  beard, and smoked his pipe in short puffs. The two men seemed to agree about
  everything, but when grown-ups agree they interrupt each other almost as much as if
  they were quarrelling. Hal said something about workmen.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> always say,&rsquo; Mr. Springett cried.
  &lsquo;A man who can only do one thing, he&rsquo;s but next-above-fool to the man that
  can&rsquo;t do nothing. That&rsquo;s where the Unions make their mistake.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;My thought to the very dot.&rsquo; Dan heard Hal slap his tight-hosed leg.
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve suffered in my time from these same Guilds&mdash;Unions d&rsquo;you
  call &rsquo;em? All their precious talk of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
  id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> mysteries of their trades&mdash;why, what does it come
  to?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Nothin&rsquo;! You&rsquo;ve just about hit it,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett, and
  rammed his hot tobacco with his thumb.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Take the art of wood-carving,&rsquo; Hal went on. He reached across the
  planks, grabbed a wooden mallet, and moved his other hand as though he wanted
  something. Mr. Springett without a word passed him one of Dan&rsquo;s broad chisels.
  &lsquo;Ah! Wood-carving, for example. If you can cut wood and have a fair draft of what
  ye mean to do, a Heaven&rsquo;s name take chisel and mall and let drive at it, say I!
  You&rsquo;ll soon find all the mystery, forsooth, of wood-carving under your proper
  hand!&rsquo; Whack, came the mallet on the chisel, and a sliver of wood curled up in
  front of it. Mr. Springett watched like an old raven.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;All art is one, man&mdash;one!&rsquo; said Hal between whacks; &lsquo;and to
  wait on another man to finish out&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;To finish out your work ain&rsquo;t no sense,&rsquo; Mr. Springett cut in.
  &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m always saying to the boy here.&rsquo; He nodded
  towards Dan. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I said when I put the new wheel into
  Brewster&rsquo;s Mill in Eighteen hundred Seventy-two. I reckoned I was millwright
  enough for the job &rsquo;thout bringin&rsquo; a man from Lunnon. An&rsquo; besides,
  dividin&rsquo; work eats up profits, no bounds.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Hal laughed his beautiful deep laugh, and Mr. Springett joined in till Dan laughed
  too.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You handle your tools, I can see,&rsquo; said Mr.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> Springett. &lsquo;I reckon,
  if you&rsquo;re any way like me, you&rsquo;ve found yourself hindered by
  those&mdash;Guilds, did you call &rsquo;em?&mdash;Unions, we say.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You may say so!&rsquo; Hal pointed to a white scar on his cheek-bone.
  &lsquo;This is a remembrance from the master watching Foreman of Masons on Magdalen
  Tower, because, please you, I dared to carve stone without their leave. They said a
  stone had slipped from the cornice by accident.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I know them accidents. There&rsquo;s no way to disprove &rsquo;em. An&rsquo;
  stones ain&rsquo;t the only things that slip,&rsquo; Mr. Springett grunted. Hal went
  on:</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a scaffold-plank keckle and shoot a too-clever workman thirty
  foot on to the cold chancel floor below. And a rope can break&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, natural as nature; an&rsquo; lime&rsquo;ll fly up in a man&rsquo;s eyes
  without any breath o&rsquo; wind sometimes,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;But
  who&rsquo;s to show &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t a accident?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Who do these things?&rsquo; Dan asked, and straightened his back at the bench
  as he turned the schooner end-for-end in the vice to get at her counter.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Them which don&rsquo;t wish other men to work no better nor quicker than they
  do,&rsquo; growled Mr. Springett. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t pinch her so hard in the vice,
  Mus&rsquo; Dan. Put a piece o&rsquo; rag in the jaws, or you&rsquo;ll bruise her. More
  than that&rsquo;&mdash;he turned towards Hal&mdash;&lsquo;if a man has his private
  spite laid up against you, the Unions give him his excuse for working it
  off.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well I know it,&rsquo; said Hal.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They never let you go, them spiteful ones. I<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> knowed a plasterer in Eighteen hundred
  Sixty-one&mdash;down to the Wells. He was a Frenchy&mdash;a bad enemy he
  was.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I had mine too. He was an Italian, called Benedetto. I met him first at
  Oxford on Magdalen Tower when I was learning my trade&mdash;or trades, I should say. A
  bad enemy he was, as you say, but he came to be my singular good friend,&rsquo; said
  Hal as he put down the mallet and settled himself comfortably.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What might his trade have been&mdash;plasterin&rsquo;?&rsquo; Mr. Springett
  asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Plastering of a sort. He worked in stucco&mdash;fresco we call it. Made
  pictures on plaster. Not but what he had a fine sweep of the hand in drawing.
  He&rsquo;d take the long sides of a cloister, trowel on his stuff, and roll out his
  great all-abroad pictures of saints and croppy-topped trees quick as a webster
  unrolling cloth almost. Oh, Benedetto could draw, but a was a little-minded man,
  professing to be full of secrets of colour or plaster&mdash;common tricks, all of
  &rsquo;em&mdash;and his one single talk was how Tom, Dick or Harry had stole this or
  t&rsquo;other secret art from him.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I know that sort,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no keeping
  peace or making peace with such. An&rsquo; they&rsquo;re mostly born an&rsquo; bone
  idle.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;True. Even his fellow-countrymen laughed at his jealousy. We two came to
  loggerheads early on Magdalen Tower. I was a youngster then. Maybe I spoke my mind
  about his work.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t never do that.&rsquo; Mr. Springett shook his head.
  &lsquo;That sort lay it up against you.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"
  id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;True enough. This Benedetto did most specially. Body o&rsquo; me, the man
  lived to hate me! But I always kept my eyes open on a plank or a scaffold. I was mighty
  glad to be shut of him when he quarrelled with his Guild foreman, and went off, nose in
  air, and paints under his arm. But&rsquo;&mdash;Hal leaned forward&mdash;&lsquo;if you
  hate a man or a man hates you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> know. You&rsquo;re everlastin&rsquo; running acrost him,&rsquo; Mr.
  Springett interrupted. &lsquo;Excuse me, sir.&rsquo; He leaned out of the window, and
  shouted to a carter who was loading a cart with bricks.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t you no more sense than to heap &rsquo;em up that way?&rsquo; he
  said. &lsquo;Take an&rsquo; throw a hundred of &rsquo;em off. It&rsquo;s more than the
  team can compass. Throw &rsquo;em off, I tell you, and make another trip for
  what&rsquo;s left over. Excuse me, sir. You was saying&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was saying that before the end of the year I went to Bury to strengthen the
  lead-work in the great Abbey east window there.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s just one of the things I&rsquo;ve never done. But I mind
  there was a cheap excursion to Chichester in Eighteen hundred Seventy-nine, an&rsquo; I
  went an&rsquo; watched &rsquo;em leading a won&rsquo;erful fine window in Chichester
  Cathedral. I stayed watchin&rsquo; till &rsquo;twas time for us to go back. Dunno as I
  had two drinks p&rsquo;raps, all that day.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Hal smiled. &lsquo;At Bury then, sure enough, I met my enemy Benedetto. He had
  painted a picture in plaster on the south wall of the Refectory&mdash;a noble place for
  a noble thing&mdash;a picture of Jonah.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64"
  id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah! Jonah an&rsquo; his whale. I&rsquo;ve never been as fur as Bury.
  You&rsquo;ve worked about a lot,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett, with his eyes on the carter
  below.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No. Not the whale. This was a picture of Jonah and the pompion that withered.
  But all that Benedetto had shown was a peevish greybeard huggled up in angle-edged
  drapery beneath a pompion on a wooden trellis. This last, being a dead thing,
  he&rsquo;d drawn it as &rsquo;twere to the life. But fierce old Jonah, bared in the
  sun, angry even to death that his cold prophecy was disproven&mdash;Jonah, ashamed, and
  already hearing the children of Nineveh running to mock him&mdash;ah, that was what
  Benedetto had <i>not</i> drawn!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He better ha&rsquo; stuck to his whale, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done no better with that. He draws the damp cloth off
  the picture, an&rsquo; shows it to me. I was a craftsman too, d&rsquo;ye see?</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis good,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but it goes no deeper than the
  plaster."</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said in a whisper.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Be thy own judge, Benedetto,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Does it go
  deeper than the plaster?"</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He reeled against a piece of dry wall. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and
  I know it. I could not hate thee more than I have done these five years, but if I live,
  I will try, Hal. I will try.&rdquo; Then he goes away. I pitied him, but I had spoken
  truth. His picture went no deeper than the plaster.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Springett, who had turned quite red. &lsquo;You was
  talkin&rsquo; so fast I didn&rsquo;t understand what you was drivin&rsquo; at.
  I&rsquo;ve seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
  men&mdash;good workmen they was&mdash;try to do more than they could do, and&mdash;and
  they couldn&rsquo;t compass it. They knowed it, and it nigh broke their hearts like.
  You was in your right, o&rsquo; course, sir, to say what you thought o&rsquo; his work;
  but if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, was you in your duty?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was wrong to say it,&rsquo; Hal replied. &lsquo;God forgive me&mdash;I was
  young! He was workman enough himself to know where he failed. But it all came evens in
  the long run. By the same token, did ye ever hear o&rsquo; one
  Torrigiano&mdash;Torrisany we called him?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say I ever did. Was he a Frenchy like?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, a hectoring, hard-mouthed, long-sworded Italian builder, as vain as a
  peacock and as strong as a bull, but, mark you, a master workman. More than
  that&mdash;he could get his best work out of the worst men.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Which it&rsquo;s a gift. I had a foreman-bricklayer like him once,&rsquo;
  said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;He used to prod &rsquo;em in the back like with a
  pointing-trowel, and they did wonders.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen our Torrisany lay a &rsquo;prentice down with one buffet and
  raise him with another&mdash;to make a mason of him. I worked under him at building a
  chapel in London&mdash;a chapel and a tomb for the king.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I never knew kings went to chapel much,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;But
  I always hold with a man, don&rsquo;t care who he be, seein&rsquo; about his own grave
  before he dies. Tidn&rsquo;t the sort of thing to leave to your family after the
  will&rsquo;s read. I reckon &rsquo;twas a fine vault.&rsquo;<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;None finer in England. This Torrigiano had the contract for it, as
  you&rsquo;d say. He picked master craftsmen from all parts&mdash;England, France,
  Italy, the Low Countries&mdash;no odds to him so long as they knew their work, and he
  drove them like&mdash;like pigs at Brightling Fair. He called us English all pigs. We
  suffered it because he was a master in his craft. If he misliked any work that a man
  had done, with his own great hands he&rsquo;d rive it out, and tear it down before us
  all. &ldquo;Ah, you pig&mdash;you English pig!&rdquo; he&rsquo;d scream in the dumb
  wretch&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You answer me? You look at me? You think at me? Come out
  with me into the cloisters. I will teach you carving myself. I will gild you all
  over!&rdquo; But when his passion had blown out, he&rsquo;d slip his arm round the
  man&rsquo;s neck, and impart knowledge worth gold. &lsquo;Twould have done your heart
  good, Mus&rsquo; Springett, to see the two hundred of us&mdash;masons, jewellers,
  carvers, gilders, iron workers and the rest&mdash;all toiling like cock-angels, and
  this mad Italian hornet fleeing from one to next up and down the chapel. &lsquo;Done
  your heart good, it would!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I believe you,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;In Eighteen hundred
  Fifty-four, I mind, the railway was bein&rsquo; made into Hastin&rsquo;s. There was two
  thousand navvies on it&mdash;all young&mdash;all strong&mdash;an&rsquo; I was one of
  &rsquo;em. Oh, dearie me! Excuse me, sir, but was your enemy workin&rsquo; with
  you?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Benedetto? Be sure he was. He followed me like a lover. He painted pictures
  on the chapel ceiling&mdash;slung from a chair. Torrigiano<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> made us promise not to
  fight till the work should be finished. We were both master craftsmen, do ye see, and
  he needed us. None the less, I never went aloft to carve &rsquo;thout testing all my
  ropes and knots each morning. We were never far from each other. Benedetto &rsquo;ud
  sharpen his knife on his sole while he waited for his plaster to dry&mdash;<i>wheet,
  wheet, wheet</i>. I&rsquo;d hear it where I hung chipping round a pillar-head, and
  we&rsquo;d nod to each other friendly-like. Oh, he was a craftsman, was Benedetto, but
  his hate spoiled his eye and his hand. I mind the night I had finished the models for
  the bronze saints round the tomb; Torrigiano embraced me before all the chapel, and
  bade me to supper. I met Benedetto when I came out. He was slavering in the porch like
  a mad dog.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Working himself up to it?&rsquo; said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;Did he have it in
  at ye that night?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, no. That time he kept his oath to Torrigiano. But I pitied him. Eh, well!
  Now I come to my own follies. I had never thought too little of myself; but after
  Torrisany had put his arm round my neck, I&mdash;I&rsquo;&mdash;Hal broke into a
  laugh&mdash;&lsquo;I lay there was not much odds &rsquo;twixt me and a cock-sparrow in
  his pride.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was pretty middlin&rsquo; young once on a time,&rsquo; said Mr.
  Springett.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then ye know that a man can&rsquo;t drink and dice and dress fine, and keep
  company above his station, but his work suffers for it, Mus&rsquo;
  Springett.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I never held much with dressin&rsquo; up, but&mdash;you&rsquo;re right! The
  worst mistakes <i>I</i> ever made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id=
  "Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> they was made on a Monday morning,&rsquo; Mr. Springett
  answered. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve all been one sort of fool or t&rsquo;other. Mus&rsquo;
  Dan, Mus&rsquo; Dan, take the smallest gouge, or you&rsquo;ll be spluttin&rsquo; her
  stern works clean out. Can&rsquo;t ye see the grain of the wood don&rsquo;t favour a
  chisel?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll spare you some of my follies. But there was a man called
  Brygandyne&mdash;Bob Brygandyne&mdash;Clerk of the King&rsquo;s Ships, a little,
  smooth, bustling atomy, as clever as a woman to get work done for nothin&rsquo;&mdash;a
  won&rsquo;erful smooth-tongued pleader. He made much o&rsquo; me, and asked me to draft
  him out a drawing, a piece of carved and gilt scroll-work for the bows of one of the
  King&rsquo;s ships&mdash;the <i>Sovereign</i> was her name.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Was she a man-of-war?&rsquo; asked Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She was a war-ship, and a woman called Catherine of Castile desired the King
  to give her the ship for a pleasure-ship of her own. <i>I</i> did not know at the time,
  but she&rsquo;d been at Bob to get this scroll-work done and fitted that the King might
  see it. I made him the picture, in an hour, all of a heat after supper&mdash;one great
  heaving play of dolphins and a Neptune or so reining in webby-footed sea-horses, and
  Arion with his harp high atop of them. It was twenty-three foot long, and maybe nine
  foot deep&mdash;painted and gilt.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It must ha&rsquo; just about looked fine,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the curiosity of it. &lsquo;Twas bad&mdash;rank bad. In my
  conceit I must needs show it to Torrigiano, in the chapel. He straddles his legs;
  hunches his knife behind him, and whistles like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69"
  id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> a storm-cock through a sleet-shower. Benedetto was
  behind him. He were never far apart, I&rsquo;ve told you.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That is pig&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; says our Master. &ldquo;Swine&rsquo;s
  work. You make any more such things, even after your fine Court suppers, and you shall
  be sent away."</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Benedetto licks his lips like a cat. &ldquo;Is it so bad then, Master?&rdquo;
  he says. &ldquo;What a pity!"</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Torrigiano. &ldquo;Scarcely <i>you</i> could do
  things so bad. I will condescend to show."</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He talks to me then and there. No shouting, no swearing (it was too bad for
  that); but good, memorable counsel, bitten in slowly. Then he sets me to draft out a
  pair of iron gates, to take, as he said, the taste of my naughty dolphins out of my
  mouth. Iron&rsquo;s sweet stuff if you don&rsquo;t torture her, and hammered work is
  all pure, truthful line, with a reason and a support for every curve and bar of it. A
  week at that settled my stomach handsomely, and the Master let me put the work through
  the smithy, where I sweated out more of my foolish pride.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Good stuff is good iron,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;I done a pair of
  lodge gates once in Eighteen hundred Sixty-three.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I forgot to say that Bob Brygandyne whipped away my draft of the
  ship&rsquo;s scroll-work, and would not give it back to me to re-draw. He said
  &rsquo;twould do well enough. Howsoever, my lawful work kept me too busied to remember
  him. Body o&rsquo; me, but I worked that winter upon<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> the gates and the bronzes for the tomb as
  I&rsquo;d never worked before! I was leaner than a lath, but I lived&mdash;I lived
  then!&rsquo; Hal looked at Mr. Springett with his wise, crinkled-up eyes, and the old
  man smiled back.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ouch!&rsquo; Dan cried. He had been hollowing out the schooner&rsquo;s
  after-deck, the little gouge had slipped and gashed the ball of his left
  thumb,&mdash;an ugly, triangular tear.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That came of not steadying your wrist,&rsquo; said Hal calmly.
  &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bleed over the wood. <i>Do</i> your work with your heart&rsquo;s
  blood, but no need to let it show.&rsquo; He rose and peered into a corner of the
  loft.</p>

  <p>Mr. Springett had risen too, and swept down a ball of cobwebs from a rafter.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Clap that on,&rsquo; was all he said, &lsquo;and put your handkerchief atop.
  &lsquo;Twill cake over in a minute. It don&rsquo;t hurt now, do it?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Dan indignantly. &lsquo;You know it has happened lots of
  times. I&rsquo;ll tie it up myself. Go on, sir.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And it&rsquo;ll happen hundreds of times more,&rsquo; said Hal with a
  friendly nod as he sat down again. But he did not go on till Dan&rsquo;s hand was tied
  up properly. Then he said:</p>

  <p>&lsquo;One dark December day&mdash;too dark to judge colour&mdash;we was all sitting
  and talking round the fires in the chapel (you heard good talk there), when Bob
  Brygandyne bustles in and&mdash;"Hal, you&rsquo;re sent for,&rdquo; he squeals. I was
  at Torrigiano&rsquo;s feet on a pile of put-locks, as I might be here, toasting a
  herring on my knife&rsquo;s point. &lsquo;Twas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
  id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> the one English thing our Master liked&mdash;salt
  herring.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy, about my art,&rdquo; I calls.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Art?&rdquo; says Bob. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Art compared to your
  scroll-work for the <i>Sovereign</i>. Come."</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Be sure your sins will find you out,&rdquo; says Torrigiano. &ldquo;Go
  with him and see.&rdquo; As I followed Bob out I was aware of Benedetto, like a black
  spot when the eyes are tired, sliddering up behind me.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Bob hurries through the streets in the raw fog, slips into a doorway, up
  stairs, along passages, and at last thrusts me into a little cold room vilely hung with
  Flemish tapestries, and no furnishing except a table and my draft of the
  <i>Sovereign&rsquo;s</i> scroll-work. Here he leaves me. Presently comes in a dark,
  long-nosed man in a fur cap.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Master Harry Dawe?&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Where a plague has Bob Brygandyne
  gone?"</p>

  <p>&lsquo;His thin eyebrows surged up a piece and come down again in a stiff bar. "He
  went to the King,&rdquo; he says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;All one. What&rsquo;s your pleasure with me?&rdquo; I says shivering,
  for it was mortal cold.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He lays his hand flat on my draft. &ldquo;Master Dawe,&rdquo; he says,
  &ldquo;do you know the present price of gold leaf for all this wicked gilding of
  yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;By that I guessed he was some cheese-paring clerk or other of the
  King&rsquo;s Ships, so I gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id=
  "Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> the price. I forget it now, but it worked out to thirty
  pounds&mdash;carved, gilt, and fitted in place.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Thirty pounds!&rdquo; he said, as though I had pulled a tooth of him.
  "You talk as though thirty pounds was to be had for the asking. None the less,&rdquo;
  he says, &ldquo;your draft&rsquo;s a fine piece of work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d been looking at it ever since I came in, and &rsquo;twas viler even
  than I judged it at first. My eye and hand had been purified the past months,
  d&rsquo;you see, by my iron work.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I could do it better now,&rdquo; I said. The more I studied my squabby
  Neptunes the less I liked &rsquo;em; and Arion was a pure flaming shame atop of the
  unbalanced dolphins.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I doubt it will be fresh expense to draft it again,&rdquo; he
  says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Bob never paid me for the first draft. I lay he&rsquo;ll never pay me
  for the second. &lsquo;Twill cost the King nothing if I re-draw it,&rdquo; I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman wishes it to be done quickly,&rdquo; he says.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stick to your first drawing, Mus&rsquo; Dawe. But thirty pounds is
  thirty pounds. You must make it less.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And all the while the faults in my draft fair leaped out and hit me between
  the eyes. At any cost, I thinks to myself, I must get it back and re-draft it. He
  grunts at me impatiently, and a splendid thought comes to me, which shall save me. By
  the same token, &rsquo;twas quite honest.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They ain&rsquo;t always,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett. &lsquo;How did you get
  out of it?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;By the truth. I says to Master Fur Cap, as<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> I might to you here, I says,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something, since you seem a knowledgeable man. Is the
  <i>Sovereign</i> to lie in Thames river all her days, or will she take the high
  seas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says quickly, &ldquo;the King keeps no cats that
  don&rsquo;t catch mice. She must sail the seas, Master Dawe. She&rsquo;ll be hired to
  merchants for the trade. She&rsquo;ll be out in all shapes o&rsquo; weathers. Does that
  make any odds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;the first heavy sea she sticks her
  nose into &rsquo;ll claw off half that scroll-work, and the next will finish it. If
  she&rsquo;s meant for a pleasure-ship give me my draft again, and I&rsquo;ll porture
  you a pretty, light piece of scroll-work, good, cheap. If she&rsquo;s meant for the
  open sea, pitch the draft into the fire. She can never carry that weight on her
  bows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He looks at me squintlings and plucks his under-lip.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Is this your honest, unswayed opinion?&rdquo; he says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Body o&rsquo; me! Ask about!&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Any seaman could
  tell you &rsquo;tis true. I&rsquo;m advising you against my own profit, but why I do so
  is my own concern.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not altogether,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some of mine.
  You&rsquo;ve saved me thirty pounds, Master Dawe, and you&rsquo;ve given me good
  arguments to use against a wilful woman that wants my fine new ship for her own toy.
  We&rsquo;ll not have any scroll-work." His face shined with pure joy.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then see that the thirty pounds you&rsquo;ve saved on it are honestly
  paid the King,&rdquo; I says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
  74]</a></span> &ldquo;and keep clear o&rsquo; womenfolk.&rdquo; I gathered up my draft
  and crumpled it under my arm. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you need of me I&rsquo;ll be
  gone,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m pressed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He turns him round and fumbles in a corner. &ldquo;Too pressed to be made a
  knight, Sir Harry?&rdquo; he says, and comes at me smiling, with three-quarters of a
  rusty sword.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I pledge you my Mark I never guessed it was the King till that moment. I
  kneeled, and he tapped me on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Rise up, Sir Harry Dawe,&rdquo; he says, and, in the same breath,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pressed, too,&rdquo; and slips through the tapestries, leaving me like
  a stuck calf.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It come over me, in a bitter wave like, that here was I, a master craftsman,
  who had worked no bounds, soul or body, to make the King&rsquo;s tomb and chapel a
  triumph and a glory for all time; and here, d&rsquo;you see, I was made knight, not for
  anything I&rsquo;d slaved over, or given my heart and guts to, but expressedly because
  I&rsquo;d saved him thirty pounds and a tongue-lashing from Catherine of
  Castile&mdash;she that had asked for the ship. That thought shrivelled me withinsides
  while I was folding away my draft. On the heels of it&mdash;maybe you&rsquo;ll see
  why&mdash;I began to grin to myself. I thought of the earnest simplicity of the
  man&mdash;the King, I should say&mdash;because I&rsquo;d saved him the money; his smile
  as though he&rsquo;d won half France! I thought of my own silly pride and foolish
  expectations that some day he&rsquo;d honour me as a master craftsman. I thought of
  the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
  broken-tipped sword he&rsquo;d found behind the hangings; the dirt of the cold room,
  and his cold eye, wrapped up in his own concerns, scarcely resting on me. Then I
  remembered the solemn chapel roof and the bronzes about the stately tomb he&rsquo;d lie
  in, and&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see?&mdash;the unreason of it all&mdash;the mad high humour of
  it all&mdash;took hold on me till I sat me down on a dark stair-head in a passage, and
  laughed till I could laugh no more. What else could I have done?</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I never heard his feet behind me&mdash;he always walked like a cat&mdash;but
  his arm slid round my neck, pulling me back where I sat, till my head lay on his chest,
  and his left hand held the knife plumb over my heart&mdash;Benedetto! Even so I
  laughed&mdash;the fit was beyond my holding&mdash;laughed while he ground his teeth in
  my ear. He was stark crazed for the time.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Laugh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Finish the laughter. I&rsquo;ll not cut
  ye short. Tell me now"&mdash;he wrenched at my head&mdash;"why the King chose to honour
  you&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;you lickspittle Englishman? I am full of patience now. I
  have waited so long.&rdquo; Then he was off at score about his Jonah in Bury Refectory,
  and what I&rsquo;d said of it, and his pictures in the chapel which all men praised and
  none looked at twice (as if that was <i>my</i> fault!) and a whole parcel of words and
  looks treasured up against me through years.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ease off your arm a little,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I cannot die by
  choking, for I am just dubbed knight, Benedetto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Tell me, and I&rsquo;ll confess ye, Sir Harry<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> Dawe, knight. There&rsquo;s
  a long night before ye. Tell,&rdquo; says he.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So I told him&mdash;his chin on my crown&mdash;told him all; told it as well
  and with as many words as I have ever told a tale at a supper with Torrigiano. I knew
  Benedetto would understand, for, mad or sad, he was a craftsman. I believed it to be
  the last tale I&rsquo;d ever tell top of mortal earth, and I would not put out bad work
  before I left the lodge. All art&rsquo;s one art, as I said. I bore Benedetto no
  malice. My spirits, d&rsquo;you see, were catched up in a high, solemn exaltation, and
  I saw all earth&rsquo;s vanities foreshortened and little, laid out below me like a
  town from a cathedral scaffolding. I told him what befell, and what I thought of it. I
  gave him the King&rsquo;s very voice at &ldquo;Master Dawe, you&rsquo;ve saved me
  thirty pounds!&rdquo; his peevish grunt while he looked for the sword; and how the
  badger-eyed figures of Glory and Victory leered at me from the Flemish hangings. Body
  o&rsquo; me, &rsquo;twas a fine, noble tale, and, as I thought, my last work on
  earth.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That is how I was honoured by the King,&rdquo; I said.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hang ye for killing me, Benedetto. And, since you&rsquo;ve killed
  in the King&rsquo;s Palace, they&rsquo;ll draw and quarter you; but you&rsquo;re too
  mad to care. Grant me, though, ye never heard a better tale.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He said nothing, but I felt him shake. My head on his chest shook; his right
  arm fell away, his left dropped the knife, and he leaned with both hands on my
  shoulder&mdash;shaking&mdash;shaking! I turned me round. No need to put my foot
  on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> his knife.
  The man was speechless with laughter&mdash;honest craftsman&rsquo;s mirth. The first
  time I&rsquo;d ever seen him laugh. You know the mirth that cuts off the very breath,
  while ye stamp and snatch at the short ribs? That was Benedetto&rsquo;s case.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When he began to roar and bay and whoop in the passage, I haled him out into
  the street, and there we leaned against the wall and had it all over again&mdash;waving
  our hands and wagging our heads&mdash;till the watch came to know if we were drunk.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Benedetto says to &rsquo;em, solemn as an owl: &ldquo;You have saved me
  thirty pound, Mus&rsquo; Dawe,&rdquo; and off he pealed. In some sort we were mad
  drunk&mdash;I because dear life had been given back to me, and he because, as he said
  afterwards, because the old crust of hatred round his heart was broke up and carried
  away by laughter. His very face had changed too.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hal,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;I forgive thee. Forgive me too, Hal. Oh,
  you English, you English! Did it gall thee, Hal, to see the rust on the dirty sword?
  Tell me again, Hal, how the King grunted with joy. Oh, let us tell the
  Master.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So we reeled back to the chapel, arms round each other&rsquo;s necks, and
  when we could speak&mdash;he thought we&rsquo;d been fighting&mdash;we told the Master.
  Yes, we told Torrigiano, and he laughed till he rolled on the new cold pavement. Then
  he knocked our heads together.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, you English,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You are more than pigs. You
  are English. Now you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg
  78]</a></span> well punished for your dirty fishes. Put the draft in the fire, and
  never do so any more. You are a fool, Hal, and you are a fool, Benedetto, but I need
  your works to please this beautiful English King&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And I meant to kill Hal,&rdquo; says Benedetto. &ldquo;Master, I meant
  to kill him because the English King had made him a knight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the Master, shaking his finger. &ldquo;Benedetto, if
  you had killed my Hal, I should have killed you&mdash;in the cloister. But you are a
  craftsman too, so I should have killed you like a craftsman, very, very slowly&mdash;in
  an hour, if I could spare the time!&rdquo; That was Torrigiano&mdash;the
  Master!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Springett sat quite still for some time after Hal had finished. Then he turned
  dark red; then he rocked to and fro; then he coughed and wheezed till the tears ran
  down his face. Dan knew by this that he was laughing, but it surprised Hal at
  first.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Excuse me, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett, &lsquo;but I was thinkin&rsquo; of
  some stables I built for a gentleman in Eighteen hundred Seventy-four. They was stables
  in blue brick&mdash;very particular work. Dunno as they weren&rsquo;t the best job
  which ever I&rsquo;d done. But the gentleman&rsquo;s lady&mdash;she&rsquo;d come from
  Lunnon, new married&mdash;she was all for buildin&rsquo; what she called a
  haw-haw&mdash;what you an&rsquo; me &rsquo;ud call a dik&mdash;right acrost his park. A
  middlin&rsquo; big job which I&rsquo;d have had the contract of, for she spoke to me in
  the library about it. But I told her there was a line o&rsquo; springs just<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> where she wanted to dig her
  ditch, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;d flood the park if she went on.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Were there any springs at all?&rsquo; said Hal.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Bound to be springs everywhere if you dig deep enough, ain&rsquo;t there? But
  what I said about the springs put her out o&rsquo; conceit o&rsquo; diggin&rsquo;
  haw-haws, an&rsquo; she took an&rsquo; built a white tile dairy instead. But when I
  sent in my last bill for the stables, the gentleman he paid it &rsquo;thout even
  lookin&rsquo; at it, and I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten nothin&rsquo;, I do assure you. More
  than that, he slips two five-pound notes into my hand in the library, an&rsquo;
  &ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; he says&mdash;he allers called me by name&mdash;"Ralph,&rdquo; he
  says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve saved me a heap of expense an&rsquo; trouble this
  autumn.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;, o&rsquo; course. I knowed he
  didn&rsquo;t want any haw-haws digged acrost his park no more&rsquo;n <i>I</i> did, but
  I never said nothing. No more he didn&rsquo;t say nothing about my blue-brick stables,
  which was really the best an&rsquo; honestest piece o&rsquo; work I&rsquo;d done in
  quite a while. He give me ten pounds for savin&rsquo; him a hem of a deal o&rsquo;
  trouble at home. I reckon things are pretty much alike, all times, in all
  places.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Hal and he laughed together. Dan couldn&rsquo;t quite understand what they thought
  so funny, and went on with his work for some time without speaking.</p>

  <p>When he looked up, Mr. Springett, alone, was wiping his eyes with his green and
  yellow pocket-handkerchief.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Bless me, Mus&rsquo; Dan, I&rsquo;ve been asleep,&rsquo; he said.
  &lsquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve dreamed a dream which has<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> made me laugh&mdash;laugh as I ain&rsquo;t
  laughed in a long day. I can&rsquo;t remember what &rsquo;twas all about, but they do
  say that when old men take to laughin&rsquo; in their sleep, they&rsquo;re
  middlin&rsquo; ripe for the next world. Have you been workin&rsquo; honest, Mus&rsquo;
  Dan?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ra-ather,&rsquo; said Dan, unclamping the schooner from the vice. &lsquo;And
  look how I&rsquo;ve cut myself with the small gouge.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ye-es. You want a lump o&rsquo; cobwebs to that,&rsquo; said Mr. Springett.
  &lsquo;Oh, I see you&rsquo;ve put it on already. That&rsquo;s right, Mus&rsquo;
  Dan.&rsquo;</p>

  Witches</h2>

  <p>When Dan took up boat-building, Una coaxed Mrs. Vincey, the farmer&rsquo;s wife at
  Little Lindens, to teach her to milk. Mrs. Vincey milks in the pasture in summer, which
  is different from milking in the shed, because the cows are not tied up, and until they
  know you they will not stand still. After three weeks Una could milk <i>Red Cow</i> or
  <i>Kitty Shorthorn</i> quite dry, without her wrists aching, and then she allowed Dan
  to look. But milking did not amuse him, and it was pleasanter for Una to be alone in
  the quiet pastures with quiet-spoken Mrs. Vincey. So, evening after evening, she
  slipped across to Little Lindens, took her stool from the fern-clump beside the fallen
  oak, and went to work, her pail between her knees, and her head pressed hard into the
  cow&rsquo;s flank. As often as not, Mrs. Vincey would be milking cross <i>Pansy</i> at
  the other end of the pasture, and would not come near till it was time to strain and
  pour off.</p>

  <p>Once, in the middle of a milking, <i>Kitty Shorthorn</i> boxed Una&rsquo;s ear with
  her tail.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You old pig!&rsquo; said Una, nearly crying, for a cow&rsquo;s tail can
  hurt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tie it down, child?&rsquo; said a voice behind her.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I meant to, but the flies are so bad I let her off&mdash;and this is what
  she&rsquo;s done!&rsquo; Una looked round, expecting Puck, and saw a curly-haired girl,
  not much taller than herself, but older, dressed in a curious high-waisted,
  lavender-coloured riding-habit, with a high hunched collar and a deep cape and a belt
  fastened with a steel clasp. She wore a yellow velvet cap and tan gauntlets, and
  carried a real hunting-crop. Her cheeks were pale except for two pretty pink patches in
  the middle, and she talked with little gasps at the end of her sentences, as though she
  had been running.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t milk so badly, child,&rsquo; she said, and when she smiled
  her teeth showed small and even and pearly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Can you milk?&rsquo; Una asked, and then flushed, for she heard Puck&rsquo;s
  chuckle.</p>

  <p>He stepped out of the fern and sat down, holding <i>Kitty Shorthorn&rsquo;s</i>
  tail. &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t much,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that Miss Philadelphia
  doesn&rsquo;t know about milk&mdash;or, for that matter, butter and eggs. She&rsquo;s a
  great housewife.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t shake hands. Mine
  are all milky; but Mrs. Vincey is going to teach me butter-making this
  summer.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah! <i>I</i>&rsquo;m going to London this summer,&rsquo; the girl said,
  &lsquo;to my aunt in Bloomsbury.&rsquo; She coughed as she began to hum, &lsquo;"Oh,
  what a town! What a wonderful metropolis!"&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a cold,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No. Only my stupid cough. But it&rsquo;s vastly<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> better than it was last winter. It will
  disappear in London air. Every one says so. D&rsquo;you like doctors, child?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know any,&rsquo; Una replied. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m sure I
  shouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Think yourself lucky, child. I beg your pardon,&rsquo; the girl laughed, for
  Una frowned.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a child, and my name&rsquo;s Una,&rsquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mine&rsquo;s Philadelphia. But everybody except Ren&eacute; calls me Phil.
  I&rsquo;m Squire Bucksteed&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;over at Marklake yonder.&rsquo; She
  jerked her little round chin towards the south behind Dallington. &lsquo;Sure-ly you
  know Marklake?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We went a picnic to Marklake Green once,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
  awfully pretty. I like all those funny little roads that don&rsquo;t lead
  anywhere.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They lead over our land,&rsquo; said Philadelphia stiffly, &lsquo;and the
  coach road is only four miles away. One can go anywhere from the Green. I went to the
  Assize Ball at Lewes last year.&rsquo; She spun round and took a few dancing steps, but
  stopped with her hand to her side.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It gives me a stitch,&rsquo; she explained. &lsquo;No odds. &lsquo;Twill go
  away in London air. That&rsquo;s the latest French step, child. Ren&eacute; taught it
  me. D&rsquo;you hate the French, chi&mdash;Una?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, I hate French, of course, but I don&rsquo;t mind Mam&rsquo;selle.
  She&rsquo;s rather decent. Is Ren&eacute; your French governess?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Philadelphia laughed till she caught her breath again.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh no! Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s a French prisoner&mdash;on parole.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> That means he&rsquo;s
  promised not to escape till he has been properly exchanged for an Englishman.
  He&rsquo;s only a doctor, so I hope they won&rsquo;t think him worth exchanging. My
  Uncle captured him last year in the <i>Ferdinand</i> privateer, off Belle Isle, and he
  cured my Uncle of a r-r-raging toothache. Of course, after <i>that</i> we
  couldn&rsquo;t let him lie among the common French prisoners at Rye, and so he stays
  with us. He&rsquo;s of very old family&mdash;a Breton, which is nearly next door to
  being a true Briton, my father says&mdash;and he wears his hair clubbed&mdash;not
  powdered. <i>Much</i> more becoming, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Una began, but
  Puck, the other side of the pail, winked, and she went on with her milking.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to be a great French physician when the war is over. He
  makes me bobbins for my lace-pillow now&mdash;he&rsquo;s very clever with his hands;
  but he&rsquo;d doctor our people on the Green if they would let him. Only our
  Doctor&mdash;Dr. Break&mdash;says he&rsquo;s an emp&mdash;&mdash;or imp
  something&mdash;worse than impostor. But my Nurse says&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Nurse! You&rsquo;re ever so old. What have you got a nurse for?&rsquo; Una
  finished milking, and turned round on her stool as <i>Kitty Shorthorn</i> grazed
  off.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Because I can&rsquo;t get rid of her. Old Cissie nursed my mother, and she
  says she&rsquo;ll nurse me till she dies. The idea! She never lets me alone. She thinks
  I&rsquo;m delicate. She has grown infirm in her understanding, you know.
  Mad&mdash;quite mad, poor Cissie!&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id=
  "Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Really mad?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Or just silly?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Crazy I should say&mdash;from the things she does. Her devotion to me is
  terribly embarrassing. You know I have all the keys of the Hall except the brewery and
  the tenants&rsquo; kitchen. I give out all stores and the linen and plate.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How jolly! I love store-rooms and giving out things.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a great responsibility you&rsquo;ll find when you come to my
  age. Last year Dad said I was fatiguing myself with my duties, and he actually wanted
  me to give up the keys to old Amoore, our housekeeper. I wouldn&rsquo;t. I hate her. I
  said, &ldquo;No, sir. I am Mistress of Marklake Hall just as long as I live, because
  I&rsquo;m never going to be married, and I shall give out stores and linen till I
  die!"&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And what did your father say?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I threatened to pin a dishclout to his coattail. He ran away. Every
  one&rsquo;s afraid of Dad, except me.&rsquo; Philadelphia stamped her foot. &lsquo;The
  idea! If I can&rsquo;t make my own father happy in his own house, I&rsquo;d like to
  meet the woman that can, and&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;d have the living hide off
  her!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She cut with her long-thonged whip. It cracked like a pistol-shot across the still
  pasture. <i>Kitty Shorthorn</i> threw up her head and trotted away.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; Philadelphia said; &lsquo;but it makes me furious.
  Don&rsquo;t you hate those ridiculous old quizzes with their feathers and fronts, who
  come to dinner and call you &ldquo;child&rdquo; in your own chair at your own
  table?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t always come to dinner,&rsquo; said Una,<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> &lsquo;but I hate being
  called "child." Please tell me about store-rooms and giving out things.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a great responsibility&mdash;particularly with that old cat
  Amoore looking at the lists over your shoulder. And such a shocking thing happened last
  summer! Poor crazy Cissie, my Nurse that I was telling you of, she took three solid
  silver tablespoons.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Took! But isn&rsquo;t that stealing?&rsquo; Una cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hsh!&rsquo; said Philadelphia, looking round at Puck. &lsquo;All I say is she
  took them without my leave. I made it right afterwards. So, as Dad says&mdash;and
  he&rsquo;s a magistrate&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t a legal offence; it was only compounding
  a felony.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It sounds awful,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It was. My dear, I was furious! I had had the keys for ten months, and
  I&rsquo;d never lost anything before. I said nothing at first, because a big house
  offers so many chances of things being mislaid, and coming to hand later.
  &ldquo;Fetching up in the lee-scuppers,&rdquo; my Uncle calls it. But next week I spoke
  to old Cissie about it when she was doing my hair at night, and she said I wasn&rsquo;t
  to worry my heart for trifles!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it like &rsquo;em?&rsquo; Una burst out. &lsquo;They see
  you&rsquo;re worried over something that really matters, and they say,
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry"; as if <i>that</i> did any good!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I quite agree with you, my dear; quite agree with you! I told Ciss the spoons
  were solid silver, and worth forty shillings, so if the thief were found, he&rsquo;d be
  tried for his life.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hanged, do you mean?&rsquo; Una said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"
  id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;They ought to be; but Dad says no jury will hang a man nowadays for a
  forty-shilling theft. They transport &rsquo;em into penal servitude at the uttermost
  ends of the earth beyond the seas, for the term of their natural life. I told Cissie
  that, and I saw her tremble in my mirror. Then she cried, and caught hold of my knees,
  and I couldn&rsquo;t for my life understand what it was all about,&mdash;she cried so.
  <i>Can</i> you guess, my dear, what that poor crazy thing had done? It was midnight
  before I pieced it together. She had given the spoons to Jerry Gamm, the Witchmaster on
  the Green, so that he might put a charm on me! Me!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Put a charm on you? Why?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> asked; and then I saw how mad poor Cissie was! You
  know this stupid little cough of mine? It will disappear as soon as I go to London. She
  was troubled about <i>that</i>, and about my being so thin, and she told me Jerry had
  promised her, if she would bring him three silver spoons, that he&rsquo;d charm my
  cough away and make me plump&mdash;"flesh-up,&rdquo; she said. I couldn&rsquo;t help
  laughing; but it was a terrible night! I had to put Cissie into my own bed, and stroke
  her hand till she cried herself to sleep. What else could I have done? When she woke,
  and I coughed&mdash;I suppose I <i>can</i> cough in my own room if I please&mdash;she
  said that she&rsquo;d killed me, and asked me to have her hanged at Lewes sooner than
  send her to the uttermost ends of the earth away from me.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How awful! What did you do, Phil?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Do? I rode off at five in the morning to talk to Master Jerry, with a new
  lash on my whip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
  Oh, I was <i>furious</i>! Witchmaster or no witchmaster, I meant
  to&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah! what&rsquo;s a Witchmaster?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A master of witches, of course. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t believe there are
  witches; but people say every village has a few, and Jerry was the master of all ours
  at Marklake. He has been a smuggler, and a man-of-war&rsquo;s man, and now he pretends
  to be a carpenter and joiner&mdash;he can make almost anything&mdash;but he really is a
  white wizard. He cures people by herbs and charms. He can cure them after Dr. Break has
  given them up, and that&rsquo;s why Dr. Break hates him so. He used to make me toy
  carts, and charm off my warts when I was a child.&rsquo; Philadelphia spread out her
  hands with the delicate shiny little nails. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t counted lucky to
  cross him. He has his ways of getting even with you, they say. But <i>I</i>
  wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Jerry! I saw him working in his garden, and I leaned out of my
  saddle and double-thonged him between the shoulders, over the hedge. Well, my dear, for
  the first time since Dad gave him to me, my <i>Troubadour</i> (I wish you could see the
  sweet creature!) shied across the road, and I spilled out into the hedge-top.
  <i>Most</i> undignified! Jerry pulled me through to his side and brushed the leaves off
  me. I was horribly pricked, but I didn&rsquo;t care. &ldquo;Now, Jerry,&rdquo; I said,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take the hide off you first, and send you to Lewes
  afterwards. You well know why.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, and he sat down among
  his bee-hives. &ldquo;Then I reckon you&rsquo;ve come about old Cissie&rsquo;s
  business, my dear.&rdquo; &ldquo;I reckon I just about have,&rdquo; I said.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> &ldquo;Stand away from
  these hives. I can&rsquo;t get at you there.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I be where
  I be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Miss Phil, I don&rsquo;t hold
  with bein&rsquo; flogged before breakfast, at my time o&rsquo; life.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s
  a huge big man, but he looked so comical squatting among the hives that&mdash;I know I
  oughtn&rsquo;t to&mdash;I laughed, and he laughed. I always laugh at the wrong time.
  But I soon recovered my dignity, and I said, &ldquo;Then give me back what you made
  poor Cissie steal!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Your pore Cissie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a hatful o&rsquo;
  trouble. But you shall have &rsquo;em, Miss Phil. They&rsquo;re all ready put by for
  you.&rdquo; And, would you believe it, the old sinner pulled my three silver spoons out
  of his dirty pocket, and polished them on his cuff! &ldquo;Here they be,&rdquo; he
  says, and he gave them to me, just as cool as though I&rsquo;d come to have my warts
  charmed. That&rsquo;s the worst of people having known you when you were young. But I
  preserved my composure. &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what in the world are we to
  do? If you&rsquo;d been caught with these things on you, you&rsquo;d have been
  hanged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re yours
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But you made my Cissie steal them,&rdquo; I said.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your Cissie, she was
  pickin&rsquo; at me and tarrifyin&rsquo; me all the long day an&rsquo; every day for
  weeks, to put a charm on you, Miss Phil, and take away your little spitty
  cough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, I knew that, Jerry, and to make me flesh up!&rdquo; I said.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, but I&rsquo;m not one of your pigs!"<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah! I reckon she&rsquo;ve been talking to you, then,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Yes, she give me no peace, and bein&rsquo; tarrified&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t
  hold with old women&mdash;I laid a task on her which I thought &rsquo;ud silence her.
  <i>I</i> never reckoned the old scrattle &rsquo;ud risk her neckbone at Lewes Assizes
  for your sake, Miss Phil. But she did. She up an&rsquo; stole, I tell ye, as cheerful
  as a tinker. You might ha&rsquo; knocked me down with any one of them liddle spoons
  when she brung &rsquo;em in her apron.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Do you mean to say, then, that you did it to try my poor
  Cissie?&rdquo; I screamed at him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What else for, dearie?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
  stand in need of hedge-stealings. I&rsquo;m a freeholder, with money in the bank; and
  now I won&rsquo;t trust women no more! Silly old besom! I do beleft she&rsquo;d
  ha&rsquo; stole the Squire&rsquo;s big fob-watch, if I&rsquo;d required her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a wicked, wicked old man,&rdquo; I said, and I was
  so angry that I couldn&rsquo;t help crying, and of course that made me cough.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Jerry was in a fearful taking. He picked me up and carried me into his
  cottage&mdash;it&rsquo;s full of foreign curiosities&mdash;and he got me something to
  eat and drink, and he said he&rsquo;d be hanged by the neck any day if it pleased me.
  He said he&rsquo;d even tell old Cissie he was sorry. That&rsquo;s a great come-down
  for a Witchmaster, you know.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was ashamed of myself for being so silly, and I dabbed my eyes and said,
  &ldquo;The least you can do now is to give poor Ciss some sort of a charm for
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s only fair dealings,&rdquo; he said.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> &ldquo;You know the names
  of the Twelve Apostles, dearie? You say them names, one by one, before your open
  window, rain or storm, wet or shine, five times a day fasting. But mind you,
  &rsquo;twixt every name you draw in your breath through your nose, right down to your
  pretty liddle toes, as long and as deep as you can, and let it out slow through your
  pretty liddle mouth. There&rsquo;s virtue for your cough in those names spoke that way.
  And I&rsquo;ll give you something you can see, moreover. Here&rsquo;s a stick of maple
  which is the warmest tree in the wood."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; Una interrupted. &lsquo;You can feel it almost as
  warm as yourself when you touch it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cut one inch long for your every year,&rdquo; Jerry said.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sixteen inches. You set it in your window so that it holds up the
  sash, and thus you keep it, rain or shine, or wet or fine, day and night. I&rsquo;ve
  said words over it which will have virtue on your complaints.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any complaints, Jerry,&rdquo; I said.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only to please Cissie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I know that as well as you do, dearie,&rdquo; he said. And&mdash;and
  that was all that came of my going to give him a flogging. I wonder whether he made
  poor <i>Troubadour</i> shy when I lashed at him? Jerry has his ways of getting even of
  people.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Well, did you try the charm? Did it
  work?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What nonsense! I told Ren&eacute; about it, of course, because he&rsquo;s a
  doctor. He&rsquo;s going to be a most famous doctor. That&rsquo;s why our
  doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> hates
  him. Ren&eacute; said, &ldquo;Oho! Your Master Gamm, he is worth knowing,&rdquo; and he
  put up his eyebrows&mdash;like this. He made joke of it all. He can see my window from
  the carpenter&rsquo;s shed, where he works, and if ever the maple stick fell down, he
  pretended to be in a fearful taking till I propped the window up again. He used to ask
  me whether I had said my Apostles properly, and how I took my deep breaths. Oh yes, and
  the next day, though he had been there ever so many times before, he put on his new hat
  and paid Jerry Gamm a visit of state&mdash;as a fellow-physician. Jerry never guessed
  Ren&eacute; was making fun of him, and so he told Ren&eacute; about the sick people in
  the village, and how he cured them with herbs after Dr. Break had given them up. Jerry
  could talk smugglers&rsquo; French, of course, and I had taught Ren&eacute; plenty of
  English, if only he wasn&rsquo;t so shy. They called each other Monsieur Gamm and
  Mosheur Lanark, just like gentlemen. I suppose it amused poor Ren&eacute;. He
  hasn&rsquo;t much to do, except to fiddle about in the carpenter&rsquo;s shop.
  He&rsquo;s like all the French prisoners&mdash;always making knick-knacks; and Jerry
  had a little lathe at his cottage, and so&mdash;and so&mdash;Ren&eacute; took to being
  with Jerry much more than I approved of. The Hall is so big and empty when Dad&rsquo;s
  away, and I will <i>not</i> sit with old Amoore&mdash;she talks so horridly about every
  one&mdash;specially about Ren&eacute;.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was rude to Ren&eacute;, I&rsquo;m afraid; but I was properly served out
  for it. One always is. You see Dad went down to Hastings to pay his respects to the
  General who commanded the brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id=
  "Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> there, and to bring him to the Hall afterwards. Dad told
  me he was a very brave soldier from India&mdash;he was Colonel of Dad&rsquo;s regiment,
  the Thirty-third Foot, after Dad left the Army, and then he changed his name from
  Wesley to Wellesley, or else the other way about; and Dad said I was to get out all the
  silver for him, and I knew that meant a big dinner. So I sent down to the sea for early
  mackerel, and had <i>such</i> a morning in the kitchen and the store-rooms. Old Amoore
  nearly cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;However, my dear, I made all my preparations in ample time, but the fish
  didn&rsquo;t arrive&mdash;it never does&mdash;and I wanted Ren&eacute; to ride to
  Pevensey and bring it himself. He had gone over to Jerry, of course, as he always used,
  unless I requested his presence beforehand. <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t send for Ren&eacute;
  every time I want him. He should be there. Now, don&rsquo;t you ever do what I did,
  child, because it&rsquo;s in the highest degree unladylike; but&mdash;but one of our
  woods runs up to Jerry&rsquo;s garden, and if you climb&mdash;it&rsquo;s ungenteel, but
  I can climb like a kitten&mdash;there&rsquo;s an old hollow oak just above the pigsty
  where you can hear and see everything below. Truthfully, I only went to tell
  Ren&eacute; about the mackerel, but I saw him and Jerry sitting on the seat playing
  with wooden toy trumpets. So I slipped into the hollow, and choked down my cough, and
  listened. Ren&eacute; had never shown <i>me</i> any of these trumpets.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Trumpets? Aren&rsquo;t you too old for trumpets?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They weren&rsquo;t real trumpets, because Jerry<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> opened his shirt collar, and Ren&eacute;
  put one end of his trumpet against Jerry&rsquo;s chest, and put his ear to the other.
  Then Jerry put his trumpet against Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s chest, and listened while
  Ren&eacute; breathed and coughed. I was afraid <i>I</i> would cough too.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;This hollywood one is the best,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
  won&rsquo;erful like hearin&rsquo; a man&rsquo;s soul whisperin&rsquo; in his innards;
  but unless I&rsquo;ve a buzzin&rsquo; in my ears, Mosheur Lanark, you make much about
  the same kind o&rsquo; noises as old Gaffer Macklin&mdash;but not quite so loud as
  young Copper. It sounds like breakers on a reef&mdash;a long way off.
  Comprenny?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;I drive on the breakers.
  But before I strike, I shall save hundreds, thousands, millions perhaps, by my little
  trumpets. Now tell me what sounds the old Gaffer Macklin have made in his chest, and
  what the young Copper also.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Jerry talked for nearly a quarter of an hour about sick people in the
  village, while Ren&eacute; asked questions. Then he sighed, and said, &ldquo;You
  explain very well, Monsieur Gamm, but if only I had your opportunities to listen for
  myself! Do you think these poor people would let me listen to them through my
  trumpet&mdash;for a little money? No?"&mdash;Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s as poor as a church
  mouse.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They&rsquo;d kill you, Mosheur. It&rsquo;s all I can do to coax
  &rsquo;em to abide it, and I&rsquo;m Jerry Gamm,&rdquo; said Jerry. He&rsquo;s very
  proud of his attainments.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then these poor people are alarmed&mdash;No?&rdquo; said
  Ren&eacute;.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had it in for me for some time back<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> because o&rsquo; my
  tryin&rsquo; your trumpets on their sick; and I reckon by the talk at the alehouse they
  won&rsquo;t stand much more. Tom Dunch an&rsquo; some of his kidney was drinkin&rsquo;
  themselves riot-ripe when I passed along after noon. Charms an&rsquo; mutterin&rsquo;s
  and bits o&rsquo; red wool and black hens is in the way o&rsquo; nature to these fools,
  Mosheur; but anything likely to do &rsquo;em real service is devil&rsquo;s work by
  their estimation. If I was you, I&rsquo;d go home before they come.&rdquo; Jerry spoke
  quite quietly, and Ren&eacute; shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am prisoner on parole, Monsieur Gamm,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
  no home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now that was unkind of Ren&eacute;. He&rsquo;s often told me that he looked
  on England as his home. I suppose it&rsquo;s French politeness.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll talk o&rsquo; something that matters,&rdquo; said
  Jerry. &ldquo;Not to name no names, Mosheur Lanark, what might be your own opinion
  o&rsquo; some one who ain&rsquo;t old Gaffer Macklin nor young Copper? Is that person
  better or worse?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Better&mdash;for time that is,&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;. He meant for
  the time being, but I never could teach him some phrases.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I thought so too,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;But how about time to
  come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ren&eacute; shook his head, and then he blew his nose. You don&rsquo;t know
  how odd a man looks blowing his nose when you are sitting directly above him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought that too,&rdquo; said Jerry. He rumbled so deep I
  could scarcely catch. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make much odds to me, because I&rsquo;m
  old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> But
  you&rsquo;re young, Mosheur&mdash;you&rsquo;re young," and he put his hand on
  Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s knee, and Ren&eacute; covered it with his hand. I didn&rsquo;t know
  they were such friends.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Thank you, <i>mon ami</i>,&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;I am much
  oblige. Let us return to our trumpet-making. But I forget"&mdash;he stood up&mdash;"it
  appears that you receive this afternoon!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t see into Gamm&rsquo;s Lane from the oak, but the gate opened,
  and fat little Doctor Break stumped in, mopping his head, and half-a-dozen of our
  people followed him, very drunk.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You ought to have seen Ren&eacute; bow; he does it beautifully.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A word with you, Laennec,&rdquo; said Dr. Break. &ldquo;Jerry has been
  practising some devilry or other on these poor wretches, and they&rsquo;ve asked me to
  be arbiter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Whatever that means, I reckon it&rsquo;s safer than asking you to be
  doctor,&rdquo; said Jerry, and Tom Dunch, one of our carters, laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t right feeling of you, Tom,&rdquo; Jerry said,
  &ldquo;seeing how clever Dr. Break put away your thorn in the flesh last winter.&rdquo;
  Tom&rsquo;s wife had died at Christmas, though Dr. Break bled her twice a week. He
  danced with rage.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;This is all beside the mark,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These good people
  are willing to testify that you&rsquo;ve been impudently prying into God&rsquo;s
  secrets by means of some papistical contrivance which this person"&mdash;he pointed to
  poor Ren&eacute;&mdash;"has furnished you with. Why, here are the things
  themselves!&rdquo; Ren&eacute; was holding a trumpet in his hand.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then all the men talked at once. They said old Gaffer Macklin was dying from
  stitches in his side where Jerry had put the trumpet&mdash;they called it the
  devil&rsquo;s ear-piece; and they said it left round red witchmarks on people&rsquo;s
  skins, and dried up their lights, and made &rsquo;em spit blood, and threw &rsquo;em
  into sweats. Terrible things they said. You never heard such a noise. I took advantage
  of it to cough.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ren&eacute; and Jerry were standing with their backs to the pigsty. Jerry
  fumbled in his big flap pockets and fished up a pair of pistols. You ought to have seen
  the men give back when he cocked his. He passed one to Ren&eacute;.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Wait! Wait!&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;I will explain to the
  doctor if he permits." He waved a trumpet at him, and the men at the gate shouted,
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it, Doctor! Don&rsquo;t lay a hand to the thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;You are not so big fool as
  you pretend, Dr. Break. No?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Dr. Break backed toward the gate, watching Jerry&rsquo;s pistol, and
  Ren&eacute; followed him with his trumpet, like a nurse trying to amuse a child, and
  put the ridiculous thing to his ear to show how it was used, and talked of <i>la
  Gloire</i>, and <i>la Humanit&eacute;</i>, and <i>la Science</i>, while Dr. Break
  watched Jerry&rsquo;s pistol and swore. I nearly laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now listen! Now listen!&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;This will be
  moneys in your pockets, my dear <i>confr&egrave;re</i>. You will become
  rich.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then Dr. Break said something about adventurers who could not earn an honest
  living in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
  106]</a></span> own country creeping into decent houses and taking advantage of
  gentlemen&rsquo;s confidence to enrich themselves by base intrigues.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ren&eacute; dropped his absurd trumpet and made one of his best bows. I knew
  he was angry from the way he rolled his &ldquo;r&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ver-r-ry good,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;For that I shall have much
  pleasure to kill you now and here. Monsieur Gamm"&mdash;another bow to Jerry&mdash;"you
  will please lend him your pistol, or he shall have mine. I give you my word I know not
  which is best; and if he will choose a second from his friends over
  there"&mdash;another bow to our drunken yokels at the gate&mdash;"we will
  commence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;Tom Dunch, you owe
  it to the doctor to be his second. Place your man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;No mixin&rsquo; in gentry&rsquo;s quarrels
  for me.&rdquo; And he shook his head and went out, and the others followed him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgot what you set
  out to do up at the alehouse just now. You was goin&rsquo; to search me for witchmarks;
  you was goin&rsquo; to duck me in the pond; you was goin&rsquo; to drag all my bits
  o&rsquo; sticks out o&rsquo; my little cottage here. What&rsquo;s the matter with you?
  Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be with your old woman to-night, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But they didn&rsquo;t even look back, much less come. They ran to the village
  alehouse like hares.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No matter for these canaille,&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;, buttoning up
  his coat so as not to show any linen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id=
  "Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> All gentlemen do that before a duel, Dad says&mdash;and
  he&rsquo;s been out five times. &ldquo;You shall be his second, Monsieur Gamm. Give him
  the pistol.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Dr. Break took it as if it was red-hot, but he said that if Ren&eacute;
  resigned his pretensions in certain quarters he would pass over the matter. Ren&eacute;
  bowed deeper than ever.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you were not the ignorant which
  you are, you would have known long ago that the subject of your remarks is not for any
  living man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the subject of his remarks might have been, but he
  spoke in a simply dreadful voice, my dear, and Dr. Break turned quite white, and said
  Ren&eacute; was a liar; and then Ren&eacute; caught him by the throat, and choked him
  black.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, my dear, as if this wasn&rsquo;t deliciously exciting enough, just
  exactly at that minute I heard a strange voice on the other side of the hedge say,
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s this, Bucksteed?&rdquo; and there was my father
  and Sir Arthur Wesley on horseback in the lane; and there was Ren&eacute; kneeling on
  Dr. Break, and there was I up in the oak, listening with all my ears.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I must have leaned forward too much, and the voice gave me such a start that
  I slipped. I had only time to make one jump on to the pigsty roof&mdash;another, before
  the tiles broke, on to the pigsty wall&mdash;and then I bounced down into the garden,
  just behind Jerry, with my hair full of bark. Imagine the situation!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I can!&rsquo; Una laughed till she nearly fell off the stool.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Dad said, &ldquo;Phil&mdash;a&mdash;del&mdash;phia!&rdquo; and Sir Arthur
  Wesley said, &ldquo;Good Ged!" and Jerry put his foot on the pistol Ren&eacute; had
  dropped. But Ren&eacute; was splendid. He never even looked at me. He began to untwist
  Dr. Break&rsquo;s neckcloth as fast as he&rsquo;d twisted it, and asked him if he felt
  better.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened? What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; said Dad.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A fit!&rdquo; said Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;I fear my
  <i>confr&egrave;re</i> has had a fit. Do not be alarmed. He recovers himself. Shall I
  bleed you a little, my dear Doctor?&rdquo; Dr. Break was very good too. He said,
  &ldquo;I am vastly obliged, Monsieur Laennec, but I am restored now.&rdquo; And as he
  went out of the gate he told Dad it was a syncope&mdash;I think. Then Sir Arthur said,
  &ldquo;Quite right, Bucksteed. Not another word! They are both gentlemen.&rdquo; And he
  took off his cocked hat to Dr. Break and Ren&eacute;.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But poor Dad wouldn&rsquo;t let well alone. He kept saying,
  &ldquo;Philadelphia, what does all this mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just come down. As
  far as I could see, it looked as though Dr. Break had had a sudden seizure.&rdquo; That
  was quite true&mdash;if you&rsquo;d seen Ren&eacute; seize him. Sir Arthur laughed.
  &ldquo;Not much change there, Bucksteed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
  lady&mdash;a thorough lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Heaven knows she doesn&rsquo;t look like one,&rdquo; said poor Dad.
  &ldquo;Go home, Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So I went home, my dear&mdash;don&rsquo;t laugh so!&mdash;right<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> under Sir Arthur&rsquo;s
  nose&mdash;a most enormous nose&mdash;feeling as though I were twelve years old, going
  to be whipped. Oh, I <i>beg</i> your pardon, child!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m getting on for
  thirteen. I&rsquo;ve never been whipped, but I know how you felt. All the same, it must
  have been funny!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Funny! If you&rsquo;d heard Sir Arthur jerking out, &ldquo;Good Ged,
  Bucksteed!" every minute as they rode behind me; and poor Dad saying, &ldquo;&rsquo;Pon
  my honour, Arthur, I can&rsquo;t account for it!&rdquo; Oh, how my cheeks tingled when
  I reached my room! But Cissie had laid out my very best evening dress, the white satin
  one, vandyked at the bottom with spots of morone foil, and the pearl knots, you know,
  catching up the drapery from the left shoulder. I had poor mother&rsquo;s lace tucker
  and her coronet comb.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, you lucky!&rsquo; Una murmured. &lsquo;<i>And</i> gloves?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;French kid, my dear&rsquo;&mdash;Philadelphia patted her
  shoulder&mdash;&lsquo;and morone satin shoes and a morone and gold crape fan. That
  restored my calm. Nice things always do. I wore my hair banded on my forehead with a
  little curl over the left ear. And when I descended the stairs, <i>en grande tenue</i>,
  old Amoore curtsied to me without my having to stop and look at her, which alas! is too
  often the case. Sir Arthur highly approved of the dinner, my dear: the mackerel
  <i>did</i> come in time. We had all the Marklake silver out, and he toasted my health,
  and he asked me where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
  110]</a></span> my little bird&rsquo;s-nesting sister was. I <i>know</i> he did it to
  quiz me, so I looked him straight in the face, my dear, and I said, &ldquo;I always
  send her to the nursery, Sir Arthur, when I receive guests at Marklake
  Hall."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, how chee&mdash;clever of you. What did he say?&rsquo; Una cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He said, &ldquo;Not much change there, Bucksteed. Ged, I deserved it,&rdquo;
  and he toasted me again. They talked about the French and what a shame it was that Sir
  Arthur only commanded a brigade at Hastings, and he told Dad of a battle in India at a
  place called Assaye. Dad said it was a terrible fight, but Sir Arthur described it as
  though it had been a whist-party&mdash;I suppose because a lady was present.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Of course you were the lady; I wish I&rsquo;d seen you,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I wish you had, child. I had <i>such</i> a triumph after dinner. Ren&eacute;
  and Dr. Break came in. They had quite made up their quarrel, and they told me they had
  the highest esteem for each other, and I laughed and said, "I heard every word of it up
  in the tree.&rdquo; You never saw two men so frightened in your life, and when I said,
  &ldquo;What <i>was</i> &lsquo;the subject of your remarks,&rsquo; Ren&eacute;?&rdquo;
  neither of them knew where to look. Oh, I quizzed them unmercifully. They&rsquo;d seen
  me jump off the pigsty roof, remember.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But what <i>was</i> the subject of their remarks?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Dr. Break said it was a professional matter, so the laugh was turned on
  me. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
  horribly afraid it might have been something unladylike and indelicate. But <i>that</i>
  wasn&rsquo;t my triumph. Dad asked me to play on the harp. Between just you and me,
  child, I had been practising a new song from London&mdash;I don&rsquo;t always live in
  trees&mdash;for weeks; and I gave it them for a surprise.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What was it?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Sing it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I have given my heart to a flower.&rdquo; Not very difficult
  fingering, but r-r-ravishing sentiment.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Philadelphia coughed and cleared her throat.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a deep voice for my age and size,&rsquo; she explained.
  &lsquo;Contralto, you know, but it ought to be stronger,&rsquo; and she began, her face
  all dark against the last of the soft pink sunset:</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&lsquo;I have given my heart to a
  flower,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though I know it is fading away,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though I know it will live but an hour</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And leave me to mourn its decay!</span><br /></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that touchingly sweet? Then the last verse&mdash;I wish I had my
  harp, dear&mdash;goes as low as my register will reach.&rsquo; She drew in her chin,
  and took a deep breath:</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&lsquo;Ye desolate whirlwinds that
  rave,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">I charge you be good to my dear!</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">She is all&mdash;she is all that I have,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the time of our parting is
  near!&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Beautiful!&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;And did they like it?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Like it? They were overwhelmed&mdash;<i>accabl&eacute;s</i>, as Ren&eacute;
  says. My dear, if I hadn&rsquo;t seen it, I shouldn&rsquo;t have believed that I could
  have drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
  tears, genuine tears, to the eyes of four grown men. But I did! Ren&eacute; simply
  couldn&rsquo;t endure it! He&rsquo;s all French sensibility. He hid his face and said,
  &ldquo;<i>Assez Mademoiselle! C&rsquo;est plus fort que moi! Assez!</i>&rdquo; And Sir
  Arthur blew his nose and said, &ldquo;Good Ged! This is worse than Assaye!&rdquo; While
  Dad sat with the tears simply running down his cheeks.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And what did Dr. Break do?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He got up and pretended to look out of the window, but I saw his little fat
  shoulders jerk as if he had the hiccoughs. That <i>was</i> a triumph. I never suspected
  him of sensibility.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I wish I&rsquo;d seen! I wish I&rsquo;d been you,&rsquo; said Una,
  clasping her hands. Puck rustled and rose from the fern, just as a big blundering
  cockchafer flew smack against Una&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

  <p>When she had finished rubbing the place, Mrs. Vincey called to her that <i>Pansy</i>
  had been fractious, or she would have come long before to help her strain and pour
  off.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo; said Una; &lsquo;I just waited. Is that old
  <i>Pansy</i> barging about the lower pasture now?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs. Vincey, listening. &lsquo;It sounds more like a horse
  being galloped middlin&rsquo; quick through the woods; but there&rsquo;s no road there.
  I reckon it&rsquo;s one of Gleason&rsquo;s colts loose. Shall I see you up to the
  house, Miss Una?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Gracious no! thank you. What&rsquo;s going to hurt me?&rsquo; said Una, and
  she put her stool away behind the oak, and strolled home through the gaps that old
  Hobden kept open for her.</p>

  <p>The children went to the seaside for a month, and lived in a flint village on the
  bare windy chalk Downs, quite thirty miles away from home. They made friends with an
  old shepherd, called Mr. Dudeney, who had known their father when their father was
  little. He did not talk like their own people in the Weald of Sussex, and he used
  different names for farm things, but he understood how they felt, and let them go with
  him. He had a tiny cottage about half a mile from the village, where his wife made mead
  from thyme honey, and nursed sick lambs in front of a coal fire, while Old Jim, who was
  Mr. Dudeney&rsquo;s sheep-dog&rsquo;s father, lay at the door. They brought up beef
  bones for Old Jim (you must never give a sheep-dog mutton bones), and if Mr. Dudeney
  happened to be far in the Downs, Mrs. Dudeney would tell the dog to take them to him,
  and he did.</p>

  <p>One August afternoon when the village water-cart had made the street smell specially
  townified, they went to look for their shepherd as usual, and, as usual, Old Jim
  crawled over the door-step and took them in charge. The sun was hot, the dry grass was
  very slippery, and the distances were very distant.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just like the sea,&rsquo; said Una, when Old Jim halted in the
  shade of a lonely flint barn on a bare rise. &lsquo;You see where you&rsquo;re going,
  and&mdash;you go there, and there&rsquo;s nothing between.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Dan slipped off his shoes. &lsquo;When we get home I shall sit in the woods all
  day,&rsquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Whuff!&rsquo; said Old Jim, to show he was ready, and struck across a long
  rolling stretch of turf. Presently he asked for his beef bone.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Dudeney? Where&rsquo;s
  master?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Old Jim looked as if he thought they were mad, and asked again.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you give it him,&rsquo; Una cried. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
  be left howling in a desert.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Show, boy! Show!&rsquo; said Dan, for the Downs seemed as bare as the palm of
  your hand.</p>

  <p>Old Jim sighed, and trotted forward. Soon they spied the blob of Mr. Dudeney&rsquo;s
  hat against the sky a long way off.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Right! All right!&rsquo; said Dan. Old Jim wheeled round, took his bone
  carefully between his blunted teeth, and returned to the shadow of the old barn,
  looking just like a wolf. The children went on. Two kestrels hung bivvering and
  squealing above them. A gull flapped lazily along the white edge of the cliffs. The
  curves of the Downs shook a little in the heat, and so did Mr. Dudeney&rsquo;s distant
  head.</p>

  <p>They walked toward it very slowly and found themselves staring into a
  horse-shoe-shaped hollow a hundred feet deep, whose steep sides were laced with tangled
  sheep-tracks. The flock grazed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id=
  "Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> the flat at the bottom, under charge of Young Jim. Mr.
  Dudeney sat comfortably knitting on the edge of the slope, his crook between his knees.
  They told him what Old Jim had done.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah, he thought you could see my head as soon as he did. The closeter you be
  to the turf the more you see things. You look warm-like,&rsquo; said Mr. Dudeney.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We be,&rsquo; said Una, flopping down. &lsquo;<i>And</i> tired.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Set beside o&rsquo; me here. The shadow&rsquo;ll begin to stretch out in a
  little while, and a heat-shake o&rsquo; wind will come up with it that&rsquo;ll overlay
  your eyes like so much wool.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want to sleep,&rsquo; said Una indignantly; but she settled
  herself as she spoke, in the first strip of early afternoon shade.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;O&rsquo; course not. You come to talk with me same as your father used.
  <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t need no dog to guide him to Norton Pit.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, he belonged here,&rsquo; said Dan, and laid himself down at length on
  the turf.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He did. And what beats me is why he went off to live among them messy trees
  in the Weald, when he might ha&rsquo; stayed here and looked all about him.
  There&rsquo;s no profit to trees. They draw the lightning, and sheep shelter under
  &rsquo;em, and <i>so</i>, like as not, you&rsquo;ll lose a half score ewes struck dead
  in one storm. Tck! Your father knew that.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Trees aren&rsquo;t messy.&rsquo; Una rose on her elbow. &lsquo;And what about
  firewood? I don&rsquo;t like coal.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Eh? You lie a piece more up-hill and you&rsquo;ll<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> lie more natural,&rsquo;
  said Mr. Dudeney, with his provoking deaf smile. &lsquo;Now press your face down and
  smell to the turf. That&rsquo;s Southdown thyme which makes our Southdown mutton beyond
  compare, and, my mother told me, &rsquo;twill cure anything except broken necks, or
  hearts. I forget which.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They sniffed, and somehow forgot to lift their cheeks from the soft thymy
  cushions.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t get nothing like that in the Weald. Watercress, maybe?&rsquo;
  said Mr. Dudeney.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But we&rsquo;ve water&mdash;brooks full of it&mdash;where you paddle in hot
  weather,&rsquo; Una replied, watching a yellow-and-violet-banded snail-shell close to
  her eye.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Brooks flood. Then you must shift your sheep&mdash;let alone foot-rot
  afterward. I put more dependence on a dew-pond any day.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s a dew-pond made?&rsquo; said Dan, and tilted his hat over his
  eyes. Mr. Dudeney explained.</p>

  <p>The air trembled a little as though it could not make up its mind whether to slide
  into the Pit or move across the open. But it seemed easiest to go down-hill, and the
  children felt one soft puff after another slip and sidle down the slope in fragrant
  breaths that baffed on their eyelids. The little whisper of the sea by the cliffs
  joined with the whisper of the wind over the grass, the hum of insects in the thyme,
  the ruffle and rustle of the flock below, and a thickish mutter deep in the very chalk
  beneath them. Mr. Dudeney stopped explaining, and went on with his
  knitting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

  <p>They were roused by voices. The shadow had crept half-way down the steep side of
  Norton&rsquo;s Pit, and on the edge of it, his back to them, Puck sat beside a
  half-naked man who seemed busy at some work. The wind had dropped, and in that funnel
  of ground every least noise and movement reached them like whispers up a
  water-pipe.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That is clever,&rsquo; said Puck, leaning over. &lsquo;How truly you shape
  it!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, but what does The Beast care for a brittle flint tip? Bah!&rsquo; The
  man flicked something contemptuously over his shoulder. It fell between Dan and
  Una&mdash;a beautiful dark-blue flint arrow-head still hot from the maker&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>

  <p>The man reached for another stone, and worked away like a thrush with a
  snail-shell.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Flint work is fool&rsquo;s work,&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;One does it
  because one always did it, but when it comes to dealing with The Beast&mdash;no
  good!&rsquo; He shook his shaggy head.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Beast was dealt with long ago. He has gone,&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be back at lambing-time. <i>I</i> know him.&rsquo; He chipped
  very carefully, and the flints squeaked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not he. Children can lie out on the Chalk now all day through and go home
  safe.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Can they? Well, call The Beast by his True Name, and I&rsquo;ll believe
  it,&rsquo; the man replied.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Surely!&rsquo; Puck leaped to his feet, curved his hands round his mouth and
  shouted: &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Norton&rsquo;s Pit threw back the echo from its dry sides&mdash;&lsquo;Wuff!
  Wuff!&rsquo; like Young Jim&rsquo;s bark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id=
  "Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;You see? You hear?&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;Nobody answers. Grey Shepherd is
  gone. Feet-in-the-Night has run off. There are no more wolves.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wonderful!&rsquo; The man wiped his forehead as though he were hot.
  &lsquo;Who drove him away? You?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Many men through many years, each working in his own country. Were you one of
  them?&rsquo; Puck answered.</p>

  <p>The man slid his sheepskin cloak to his waist, and without a word pointed to his
  side, which was all seamed and blotched with scars. His arms too were dimpled from
  shoulder to elbow with horrible white dimples.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;It is The Beast&rsquo;s mark. What did you
  use against him?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hand, hammer, and spear, as our fathers did before us.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So? Then how&rsquo;&mdash;Puck twitched aside the man&rsquo;s dark-brown
  cloak&mdash;&lsquo;how did a Flint-worker come by <i>that</i>? Show, man, show!&rsquo;
  He held out his little hand.</p>

  <p>The man slipped a long dark iron knife, almost a short sword, from his belt, and
  after breathing on it, handed it hilt-first to Puck, who took it with his head on one
  side, as you should when you look at the works of a watch, squinted down the dark
  blade, and very delicately rubbed his forefinger from the point to the hilt.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; said he, in a surprised tone.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It should be. The Children of the Night made it,&rsquo; the man answered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So I see by the iron. What might it have cost you?&rsquo;<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;This!&rsquo; The man raised his hand to his cheek. Puck whistled like a Weald
  starling.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;By the Great Rings of the Chalk!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Was <i>that</i> your
  price? Turn sunward that I may see better, and shut your eye.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He slipped his hand beneath the man&rsquo;s chin and swung him till he faced the
  children up the slope. They saw that his right eye was gone, and the eyelid lay shrunk.
  Quickly Puck turned him round again, and the two sat down.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It was for the sheep. The sheep are the people,&rsquo; said the man, in an
  ashamed voice. &lsquo;What else could I have done? <i>You</i> know, Old One.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Puck sighed a little fluttering sigh. &lsquo;Take the knife. I listen.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The man bowed his head, drove the knife into the turf, and while it still quivered
  said: &lsquo;This is witness between us that I speak the thing that has been. Before my
  Knife and the Naked Chalk I speak. Touch!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Puck laid a hand on the hilt. It stopped shaking. The children wriggled a little
  nearer.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I am of the People of the Worked Flint. I am the one son of the Priestess who
  sells the Winds to the Men of the Sea. I am the Buyer of the Knife&mdash;the Keeper of
  the People,&rsquo; the man began, in a sort of singing shout. &lsquo;These are my names
  in this country of the Naked Chalk, between the Trees and the Sea.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yours was a great country. Your names are great too,&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;One cannot feed some things on names and songs&rsquo;; the man hit himself on
  the chest. &lsquo;It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg
  126]</a></span> better&mdash;always better&mdash;to count one&rsquo;s children safe
  round the fire, their Mother among them.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ahai!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;I think this will be a very old
  tale.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I warm myself and eat at any fire that I choose, but there is no <i>one</i>
  to light me a fire or cook my meat. I sold all that when I bought the Magic Knife for
  my people. It was not right that The Beast should master man. What else could I have
  done?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I hear. I know. I listen,&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;When I was old enough to take my place in the Sheepguard, The Beast gnawed
  all our country like a bone between his teeth. He came in behind the flocks at
  watering-time, and watched them round the Dew-ponds; he leaped into the folds between
  our knees at the shearing; he walked out alongside the grazing flocks, and chose his
  meat on the hoof while our boys threw flints at him; he crept by night into the huts,
  and licked the babe from between the mother&rsquo;s hands; he called his companions and
  pulled down men in broad daylight on the Naked Chalk. No&mdash;not always did he do so!
  <i>This</i> was his cunning! He would go away for a while to let us forget him. A
  year&mdash;two years perhaps&mdash;we neither smelt, nor heard, nor saw him. When our
  flocks had increased; when our men did not always look behind them; when children
  strayed from the fenced places; when our women walked alone to draw water&mdash;back,
  back, back came the Curse of the Chalk, Grey Shepherd, Feet-in-the Night&mdash;The
  Beast, The Beast, The Beast!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He laughed at our little brittle arrows and our poor blunt spears. He learned
  to run in under the stroke of the hammer. I think he knew when there was a flaw in the
  flint. Often it does not show till you bring it down on his snout.
  Then&mdash;<i>Pouf!</i>&mdash;the false flint falls all to flinders, and you are left
  with the hammer-handle in your fist, and his teeth in your flank! I have felt them. At
  evening, too, in the dew, or when it has misted and rained, your spear-head lashings
  slack off, though you have kept them beneath your cloak all day. You are
  alone&mdash;but so close to the home ponds that you stop to tighten the sinews with
  hands, teeth, and a piece of driftwood. You bend over and pull&mdash;so! That is the
  minute for which he has followed you since the stars went out. &ldquo;Aarh!&rdquo; he
  says. "Wurr-aarh!&rdquo; he says.&rsquo; (Norton&rsquo;s Pit gave back the growl like a
  pack of real wolves.) &lsquo;Then he is on your right shoulder feeling for the vein in
  your neck, and&mdash;perhaps your sheep run on without you. To fight The Beast is
  nothing, but to be despised by The Beast when he fights you&mdash;that is like his
  teeth in the heart! Old One, why is it that men desire so greatly, and can do so
  little?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I do not know. Did you desire so much?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I desired to master The Beast. It is not right that The Beast should master
  man. But my people were afraid. Even my Mother, the Priestess, was afraid when I told
  her what I desired. We were accustomed to be afraid of The Beast. When I was made a
  man, and a maiden&mdash;she was a Priestess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id=
  "Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>&mdash;waited for me at the Dew-ponds, The Beast flitted
  from off the Chalk. Perhaps it was a sickness; perhaps he had gone to his Gods to learn
  how to do us new harm. But he went, and we breathed more freely. The women sang again;
  the children were not so much guarded; our flocks grazed far out. I took mine
  yonder&rsquo;&mdash;he pointed inland to the hazy line of the Weald&mdash;&lsquo;where
  the new grass was best. They grazed north. I followed till we were close to the
  Trees&rsquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;&lsquo;close <i>there</i> where the
  Children of the Night live,&rsquo; He pointed north again.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah, now I remember a thing,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;Tell me, why did your
  people fear the Trees so extremely?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Because the Gods hate the Trees and strike them with lightning. We can see
  them burning for days all along the Chalk&rsquo;s edge. Besides, all the Chalk knows
  that the Children of the Night, though they worship our Gods, are magicians. When a man
  goes into their country, they change his spirit; they put words into his mouth; they
  make him like talking water. But a voice in my heart told me to go toward the north.
  While I watched my sheep there I saw three Beasts chasing a man, who ran toward the
  Trees. By this I knew he was a Child of the Night. We Flint-workers fear the Trees more
  than we fear The Beast. He had no hammer; he carried a knife like this one. A Beast
  leaped at him. He stretched out his knife. The Beast fell dead. The other Beasts ran
  away howling, which they would never have done from a Flint-worker. The man went
  in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> among the
  Trees. I looked for the dead Beast. He had been killed in a new way&mdash;by a single
  deep, clean cut, without bruise or tear, which had split his bad heart. Wonderful! So I
  saw that the man&rsquo;s knife was magic, and I thought how to get it,&mdash;thought
  strongly how to get it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When I brought the flocks to the shearing, my Mother the Priestess asked me,
  &ldquo;What is the new thing which you have seen and I see in your face?&rdquo; I said,
  &ldquo;It is a sorrow to me"; and she answered, &ldquo;All new things are sorrow. Sit
  in my place, and eat sorrow.&rdquo; I sat down in her place by the fire, where she
  talks to the ghosts in winter, and two voices spoke in my heart. One voice said,
  &ldquo;Ask the Children of the Night for the Magic Knife. It is not fit that The Beast
  should master man.&rdquo; I listened to that voice.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;One voice said, &ldquo;If you go among the Trees, the Children of the Night
  will change your spirit. Eat and sleep here.&rdquo; The other voice said, &ldquo;Ask
  for the Knife.&rdquo; I listened to that voice.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I said to my Mother in the morning, &ldquo;I go away to find a thing for the
  people, but I do not know whether I shall return in my own shape.&rdquo; She answered,
  &ldquo;Whether you live or die, or are made different, I am your Mother."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;The Old Ones themselves cannot change
  men&rsquo;s mothers even if they would.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Let us thank the Old Ones! I spoke to my Maiden, the Priestess who waited for
  me at the Dew-ponds. She promised fine things too.&rsquo; The man laughed. &lsquo;I
  went away to that place where I had seen the magician with the knife. I lay
  out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> two days
  on the short grass before I ventured among the Trees. I felt my way before me with a
  stick. I was afraid of the terrible talking Trees. I was afraid of the ghosts in the
  branches; of the soft ground underfoot; of the red and black waters. I was afraid,
  above all, of the Change. It came!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They saw him wipe his forehead once again, and his strong back-muscles quivered till
  he laid his hand on the knife-hilt.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A fire without a flame burned in my head; an evil taste grew in my mouth; my
  eyelids shut hot over my eyes; my breath was hot between my teeth, and my hands were
  like the hands of a stranger. I was made to sing songs and to mock the Trees, though I
  was afraid of them. At the same time I saw myself laughing, and I was very sad for this
  fine young man, who was myself. Ah! The Children of the Night know magic.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I think that is done by the Spirits of the Mist. They change a man if he
  sleeps among them,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;Had you slept in any mists?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;but <i>I</i> know it was the Children of the Night. After three
  days I saw a red light behind the Trees, and I heard a heavy noise. I saw the Children
  of the Night dig red stones from a hole, and lay them in fires. The stones melted like
  tallow, and the men beat the soft stuff with hammers. I wished to speak to these men,
  but the words were changed in my mouth, and all I could say was, &ldquo;Do not make
  that noise. It hurts my head.&rdquo; By this I knew that I was bewitched,<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> and I clung to the
  Trees, and prayed the Children of the Night to take off their spells. They were cruel.
  They asked me many questions which they would never allow me to answer. They changed my
  words between my teeth till I wept. Then they led me into a hut and covered the floor
  with hot stones and dashed water on the stones, and sang charms till the sweat poured
  off me like water. I slept. When I waked, my own spirit&mdash;not the strange, shouting
  thing&mdash;was back in my body, and I was like a cool bright stone on the shingle
  between the sea and the sunshine. The magicians came to hear me&mdash;women and
  men&mdash;each wearing a Magic Knife. Their Priestess was their Ears and their
  Mouth.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I spoke. I spoke many words that went smoothly along like sheep in order when
  their shepherd, standing on a mound, can count those coming, and those far off getting
  ready to come. I asked for Magic Knives for my people. I said that my people would
  bring meat, and milk, and wool, and lay them in the short grass outside the Trees, if
  the Children of the Night would leave Magic Knives for our people to take away. They
  were pleased. Their Priestess said, &ldquo;For whose sake have you come?&rdquo; I
  answered, &ldquo;The sheep are the people. If The Beast kills our sheep, our people
  die. So I come for a Magic Knife to kill The Beast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She said, &ldquo;We do not know if our God will let us trade with the people
  of the Naked Chalk. Wait till we have asked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When they came back from the Question place<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> (their Gods are our Gods), their Priestess
  said, &ldquo;The God needs a proof that your words are true." I said, &ldquo;What is
  the proof?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;The God says that if you have come for the sake of
  your people you will give him your right eye to be put out; but if you have come for
  any other reason you will not give it. This proof is between you and the God. We
  ourselves are sorry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I said, &ldquo;This is a hard proof. Is there no other road?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She said, &ldquo;Yes. You can go back to your people with your two eyes in
  your head if you choose. But then you will not get any Magic Knives for your
  people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I said, &ldquo;It would be easier if I knew that I were to be
  killed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She said, &ldquo;Perhaps the God knew this too. See! I have made my knife
  hot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I said, &ldquo;Be quick, then!&rdquo; With her knife heated in the flame she
  put out my right eye. She herself did it. I am the son of a Priestess. She was a
  Priestess. It was not work for any common man.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;True! Most true,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;No common man&rsquo;s work, that.
  And, afterwards?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Afterwards I did not see out of that eye any more. I found also that a one
  eye does not tell you truly where things are. Try it!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>At this Dan put his hand over one eye, and reached for the flint arrow-head on the
  grass. He missed it by inches. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; he whispered to Una.
  &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t judge distances a bit with only one eye.&rsquo;<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

  <p>Puck was evidently making the same experiment, for the man laughed at him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I know it is so,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Even now I am not always sure of my
  blow. I stayed with the Children of the Night till my eye healed. They said I was the
  son of Tyr, the God who put his right hand in a Beast&rsquo;s mouth. They showed me how
  they melted their red stone and made the Magic Knives of it. They told me the charms
  they sang over the fires and at the beatings. I can sing many charms.&rsquo; Then he
  began to laugh like a boy.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was thinking of my journey home,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and of the
  surprised Beast. He had come back to the Chalk. I saw him&mdash;I smelt his lairs as
  soon as ever I left the Trees. He did not know I had the Magic Knife&mdash;I hid it
  under my cloak&mdash;the Knife that the Priestess gave me. Ho! Ho! That happy day was
  too short! See! A Beast would wind me. &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;here is
  my Flint-worker!&rdquo; He would come leaping, tail in air; he would roll; he would lay
  his head between his paws out of merriness of heart at his warm, waiting meal. He would
  leap&mdash;and, oh, his eye in mid-leap when he saw&mdash;when he saw the knife held
  ready for him! It pierced his hide as a rush pierces curdled milk. Often he had no time
  to howl. I did not trouble to flay any beasts I killed. Sometimes I missed my blow.
  Then I took my little flint hammer and beat out his brains as he cowered. He made no
  fight. He knew the knife! But The Beast is very cunning. Before evening all The Beasts
  had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> smelt the
  blood on my knife, and were running from me like hares. <i>They</i> knew! Then I walked
  as a man should&mdash;the Master of The Beast!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So came I back to my Mother&rsquo;s house. There was a lamb to be killed. I
  cut it in two halves with my knife, and I told her all my tale. She said, &ldquo;This
  is the work of a God.&rdquo; I kissed her and laughed. I went to my Maiden who waited
  for me at the Dew-ponds. There was a lamb to be killed. I cut it in two halves with my
  knife, and told her all my tale. She said, &ldquo;It is the work of a God.&rdquo; I
  laughed, but she pushed me away, and being on my blind side, ran off before I could
  kiss her. I went to the Men of the Sheepguard at watering-time. There was a sheep to be
  killed for their meat. I cut it in two halves with my knife, and told them all my tale.
  They said, &ldquo;It is the work of a God.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;We talk too much about
  Gods. Let us eat and be happy, and to-morrow I will take you to the Children of the
  Night, and each man will find a Magic Knife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was glad to smell our sheep again; to see the broad sky from edge to edge,
  and to hear the sea. I slept beneath the stars in my cloak. The men talked among
  themselves.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I led them, the next day, to the Trees, taking with me meat, wool, and
  curdled milk, as I had promised. We found the Magic Knives laid out on the grass, as
  the Children of the Night had promised. They watched us from among the Trees. Their
  Priestess called to me and said, &ldquo;How is it with your people?&rdquo; I said,
  &ldquo;Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
  hearts are changed. I cannot see their hearts as I used to.&rdquo; She said,
  &ldquo;That is because you have only one eye. Come to me and I will be both your
  eyes.&rdquo; But I said, &ldquo;I must show my people how to use their knives against
  The Beast, as you showed me how to use my knife.&rdquo; I said this because the Magic
  Knife does not balance like the flint. She said, &ldquo;What you have done, you have
  done for the sake of a woman, and not for the sake of your people.&rdquo; I asked of
  her, &ldquo;Then why did the God accept my right eye, and why are you so angry?&rdquo;
  She answered, &ldquo;Because any man can lie to a God, but no man can lie to a woman.
  And I am not angry with you. I am only very sorrowful for you. Wait a little, and you
  will see out of your one eye why I am sorry.&rdquo; So she hid herself.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I went back with my people, each one carrying his knife, and making it sing
  in the air&mdash;<i>tssee-sssse</i>. The Flint never sings. It
  mutters&mdash;<i>ump-ump</i>. The Beast heard. The Beast saw. <i>He</i> knew!
  Everywhere he ran away from us. We all laughed. As we walked over the grass my
  Mother&rsquo;s brother&mdash;the Chief on the Man&rsquo;s Side&mdash;he took off his
  Chief&rsquo;s necklace of yellow sea-stones.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How? Eh? Oh, I remember! Amber,&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And would have put them on my neck. I said, &ldquo;No, I am content. What
  does my one eye matter if my other eye sees fat sheep and fat children running about
  safely?&rdquo; My Mother&rsquo;s brother said to them, &ldquo;I told you he would
  never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> take
  such things." Then they began to sing a song in the Old Tongue&mdash;<i>The Song of
  Tyr</i>. I sang with them, but my Mother&rsquo;s brother said, &ldquo;This is
  <i>your</i> song, oh, Buyer of the Knife. Let <i>us</i> sing it, Tyr.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Even then I did not understand, till I saw that&mdash;that no man stepped on
  my shadow; and I knew that they thought me to be a God, like the God Tyr, who gave his
  right hand to conquer a Great Beast.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;By the Fire in the Belly of the Flint, was that so?&rsquo; Puck rapped
  out.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;By my Knife and the Naked Chalk, so it was! They made way for my shadow as
  though it had been a Priestess walking to the Barrows of the Dead. I was afraid. I said
  to myself, &ldquo;My Mother and my Maiden will know I am not Tyr.&rdquo; But
  <i>still</i> I was afraid with the fear of a man who falls into a steep flint-pit while
  he runs, and feels that it will be hard to climb out.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When we came to the Dew-ponds all our people were there. The men showed their
  knives and told their tale. The sheepguards also had seen The Beast flying from us. The
  Beast went west across the river in packs&mdash;howling! He knew the Knife had come to
  the Naked Chalk at last&mdash;at last! <i>He</i> knew! So my work was done. I looked
  for my Maiden among the Priestesses. She looked at me, but she did not smile. She made
  the sign to me that our Priestesses must make when they sacrifice to the Old Dead in
  the Barrows. I would have spoken, but my Mother&rsquo;s brother made himself my Mouth,
  as though I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg
  137]</a></span> been one of the Old Dead in the Barrows for whom our Priests speak to
  the people on Midsummer mornings.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I remember. Well I remember those Midsummer mornings!&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then I went away angrily to my Mother&rsquo;s house. She would have knelt
  before me. Then I was more angry, but she said, &ldquo;Only a God would have spoken to
  me thus, a Priestess. A man would have feared the punishment of the Gods.&rdquo; I
  looked at her and I laughed. I could not stop my unhappy laughing. They called me from
  the door by the name of Tyr himself. A young man with whom I had watched my first
  flocks, and chipped my first arrow, and fought my first Beast, called me by that name
  in the Old Tongue. He asked my leave to take my Maiden. His eyes were lowered, his
  hands were on his forehead. He was full of the fear of a God, but of <i>me</i>, a man,
  he had no fear when he asked. I did not kill him. I said, "Call the maiden.&rdquo; She
  came also without fear&mdash;this very one that had waited for me, that had talked with
  me by our Dew-ponds. Being a Priestess, she lifted her eyes to me. As I look on a hill
  or a cloud, so she looked at me. She spoke in the Old Tongue which Priestesses use when
  they make prayers to the Old Dead in the Barrows. She asked leave that she might light
  the fire in my companion&rsquo;s house&mdash;and that I should bless their children. I
  did not kill her. I heard my own voice, little and cold, say, &ldquo;Let it be as you
  desire,&rdquo; and they went away hand in hand. My heart grew little and<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> cold, a wind shouted in
  my ears; my eye darkened. I said to my Mother, &ldquo;Can a God die?&rdquo; I heard her
  say, &ldquo;What is it? What is it, my son?&rdquo; and I fell into darkness full of
  hammer-noises. I was not.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, poor&mdash;poor God!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;And your wise
  Mother?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>She</i> knew. As soon as I dropped she knew. When my spirit came back I
  heard her whisper on my ear, &ldquo;Whether you live or die, or are made different, I
  am your Mother.&rdquo; That was good&mdash;better even than the water she gave me and
  the going away of the sickness. Though I was ashamed to have fallen down, yet I was
  very glad. She was glad too. Neither of us wished to lose the other. There is only the
  one Mother for the one son. I heaped the fire for her, and barred the doors, and sat at
  her feet as before I went away, and she combed my hair, and sang.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I said at last, &ldquo;What is to be done to the people who say that I am
  Tyr?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She said, &ldquo;He who has done a God-like thing must bear himself like a
  God. I see no way out of it. The people are now your sheep till you die. You cannot
  drive them off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I said, &ldquo;This is a heavier sheep than I can lift.&rdquo; She said,
  &ldquo;In time it will grow easy. In time perhaps you will not lay it down for any
  maiden anywhere. Be wise&mdash;be very wise, my son, for nothing is left you except the
  words, and the songs, and the worship of a God."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, poor God!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;But those are not altogether bad
  things.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg
  139]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I know they are not; but I would sell them all&mdash;all&mdash;all for one
  small child of my own, smearing himself with the ashes of our own
  house-fire.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He wrenched his knife from the turf, thrust it into his belt and stood up.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And yet, what else could I have done?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The sheep are
  the people.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It is a very old tale,&rsquo; Puck answered. &lsquo;I have heard the like of
  it not only on the Naked Chalk, but also among the Trees&mdash;under Oak, and Ash, and
  Thorn.&rsquo;</p>
  <hr style="width: 45%;" />

  <p>The afternoon shadows filled all the quiet emptiness of Norton&rsquo;s Pit. The
  children heard the sheep bells and Young Jim&rsquo;s busy bark above them, and they
  scrambled up the slope to the level.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We let you have your sleep out,&rsquo; said Mr. Dudeney, as the flock
  scattered before them. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s making for tea-time now.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Look what I&rsquo;ve found,&rsquo; said Dan, and held up a little blue flint
  arrow-head as fresh as though it had been chipped that very day.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mr. Dudeney, &lsquo;the closeter you be to the turf the more
  you&rsquo;re apt to see things. I&rsquo;ve found &rsquo;em often. Some says the fairies
  made &rsquo;em, but I says they was made by folks like ourselves&mdash;only a goodish
  time back. They&rsquo;re lucky to keep. Now, you couldn&rsquo;t ever have
  slept&mdash;not to any profit&mdash;among your father&rsquo;s trees same as
  you&rsquo;ve laid out on Naked Chalk&mdash;could you?&rsquo;<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;One doesn&rsquo;t want to sleep in the woods,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then what&rsquo;s the good of &rsquo;em?&rsquo; said Mr. Dudeney.
  &lsquo;Might as well set in the barn all day. Fetch &rsquo;em &lsquo;long, Jim
  boy!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The Downs, that looked so bare and hot when they came, were full of delicious little
  shadow-dimples; the smell of the thyme and the salt mixed together on the south-west
  drift from the still sea; their eyes dazzled with the low sun, and the long grass under
  it looked golden. The sheep knew where their fold was, so Young Jim came back to his
  master, and they all four strolled home, the scabious-heads swishing about their
  ankles, and their shadows streaking behind them like the shadows of giants.</p>

  <p>It was almost the end of their visit to the seaside. They had turned themselves out
  of doors while their trunks were being packed, and strolled over the Downs towards the
  dull evening sea. The tide was dead low under the chalk cliffs, and the little wrinkled
  waves grieved along the sands up the coast to Newhaven and down the coast to long, grey
  Brighton, whose smoke trailed out across the Channel.</p>

  <p>They walked to The Gap where the cliff is only a few feet high. A windlass for
  hoisting shingle from the beach below stands at the edge of it. The Coastguard cottages
  are a little farther on, and an old ship&rsquo;s figure-head of a Turk in a turban
  stared at them over the wall.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;This time to-morrow we shall be at home, thank goodness,&rsquo; said Una.
  &lsquo;I hate the sea!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I believe it&rsquo;s all right in the middle,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;The
  edges are the sorrowful parts.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Cordery, the coastguard, came out of the cottage, levelled his telescope at some
  fishing-boats, shut it with a click and walked away. He grew smaller and smaller along
  the edge of the cliff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
  148]</a></span> where neat piles of white chalk every few yards show the path even on
  the darkest night.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Cordery going?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Half-way to Newhaven,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;Then he&rsquo;ll meet the
  Newhaven coastguard and turn back. He says if coastguards were done away with,
  smuggling would start up at once.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>A voice on the beach under the cliff began to sing:</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;The moon she shined on Telscombe Tye&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i4">On Telscombe Tye at night it was&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i2">She saw the smugglers riding by,</span><br />
  <span class="i4">A very pretty sight it was!&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>Feet scrabbled on the flinty path. A dark, thin-faced man in very neat brown clothes
  and broad-toed shoes came up, followed by Puck.</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;Three Dunkirk boats was standin&rsquo;
  in!&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>the man went on.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hssh!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll shock these nice young
  people.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh! Shall I? Mille pardons!&rsquo; He shrugged his shoulders almost up to his
  ears&mdash;spread his hands abroad, and jabbered in French. &lsquo;No comprenny?&rsquo;
  he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give it you in Low German.&rsquo; And he went off in another
  language, changing his voice and manner so completely that they hardly knew him for the
  same person. But his dark beady-brown eyes still twinkled merrily in his lean face, and
  the children felt that they did not suit the straight, plain, snuffy-brown coat, brown
  knee-breeches, and broad-brimmed hat. His hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149"
  id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> was tied in a short pig-tail which danced wickedly
  when he turned his head.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ha&rsquo; done!&rsquo; said Puck, laughing. &lsquo;Be one thing or
  t&rsquo;other, Pharaoh&mdash;French or English or German&mdash;no great odds
  which.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, but it is, though,&rsquo; said Una quickly. &lsquo;We haven&rsquo;t begun
  German yet, and&mdash;and we&rsquo;re going back to our French next week.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you English?&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;We heard you singing just
  now.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Aha! That was the Sussex side o&rsquo; me. Dad he married a French girl out
  o&rsquo; Boulogne, and French she stayed till her dyin&rsquo; day. She was an Aurette,
  of course. We Lees mostly marry Aurettes. Haven&rsquo;t you ever come across the
  saying:</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;Aurettes and Lees,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Like as two peas.</span><br />
  <span class="i2">What they can&rsquo;t smuggle,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">They&rsquo;ll run over seas?&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then, are you a smuggler?&rsquo; Una cried; and, &lsquo;Have you smuggled
  much?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lee nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mind you,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t uphold smuggling for the
  generality o&rsquo; mankind&mdash;mostly they can&rsquo;t make a do of it&mdash;but I
  was brought up to the trade, d&rsquo;ye see, in a lawful line o&rsquo; descent
  on&rsquo;&mdash;he waved across the Channel&mdash;&lsquo;on both sides the water.
  &lsquo;Twas all in the families, same as fiddling. The Aurettes used mostly to run the
  stuff across from Boulogne, and we Lees landed it here and ran it up to London town, by
  the safest road.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then where did you live?&rsquo; said Una.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t ever live too close to your business in <i>our</i> trade.
  We kept our little fishing smack at Shoreham, but otherwise we Lees was all honest
  cottager folk&mdash;at Warminghurst under Washington&mdash;Bramber way&mdash;on the old
  Penn estate.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Puck, squatted by the windlass. &lsquo;I remember a piece
  about the Lees at Warminghurst, I do:</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;There was never a Lee to Warminghurst</span><br />
  <span class="i2">That wasn&rsquo;t a gipsy last and first.</span><br /></p>

  <p>I reckon that&rsquo;s truth, Pharaoh.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Pharaoh laughed. &lsquo;Admettin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my
  gipsy blood must be wore pretty thin, for I&rsquo;ve made and kept a worldly
  fortune.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;By smuggling?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, in the tobacco trade.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you gave up smuggling just to go and be a
  tobacconist!&rsquo; Dan looked so disappointed they all had to laugh.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; but there&rsquo;s all sorts of tobacconists,&rsquo; Pharaoh
  replied. &lsquo;How far out, now, would you call that smack with the patch on her
  foresail?&rsquo; He pointed to the fishing-boats.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A scant mile,&rsquo; said Puck after a quick look.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Just about. It&rsquo;s seven fathom under her&mdash;clean sand. That was
  where Uncle Aurette used to sink his brandy kegs from Boulogne, and we fished &rsquo;em
  up and rowed &rsquo;em into The Gap here for the ponies to run inland. One thickish
  night in January of &lsquo;93, Dad and Uncle Lot and me came over from Shoreham in the
  smack, and we found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg
  151]</a></span> Uncle Aurette and the L&rsquo;Estranges, my cousins, waiting for us in
  their lugger with New Year&rsquo;s presents from mother&rsquo;s folk in Boulogne. I
  remember Aunt Cecile she&rsquo;d sent me a fine new red knitted cap, which I put on
  then and there, for the French was having their Revolution in those days, and red caps
  was all the fashion. Uncle Aurette tells us that they had cut off their King
  Louis&rsquo; head, and, moreover, the Brest forts had fired on an English
  man-o&rsquo;-war. The news wasn&rsquo;t a week old.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That means war again, when we was only just getting used to the
  peace,&rdquo; says Dad. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t King George&rsquo;s men and King
  Louis&rsquo; men do on their uniforms and fight it out over our heads?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Me too, I wish that,&rdquo; says Uncle Aurette. &ldquo;But
  they&rsquo;ll be pressing better men than themselves to fight for &rsquo;em. The
  press-gangs are out already on our side: you look out for yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to bide ashore and grow cabbages for a while, after
  I&rsquo;ve run this cargo; but I do wish"&mdash;Dad says, going over the lugger&rsquo;s
  side with our New Year presents under his arm and young L&rsquo;Estrange holding the
  lantern&mdash;"I just do wish that those folk which make war so easy had to run one
  cargo a month all this winter. It &rsquo;ud show &rsquo;em what honest work
  means.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve warned ye,&rdquo; says Uncle Aurette.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be slipping off now before your Revenue cutter comes. Give my love to
  sister and take care o&rsquo; the kegs. It&rsquo;s thicking to southward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I remember him waving to us and young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"
  id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> Stephen L&rsquo;Estrange blowing out the lantern. By
  the time we&rsquo;d fished up the kegs the fog came down so thick Dad judged it risky
  for me to row &rsquo;em ashore, even though we could hear the ponies stamping on the
  beach. So he and Uncle Lot took the dinghy and left me in the smack playing on my
  fiddle to guide &rsquo;em back.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Presently I heard guns. Two of &rsquo;em sounded mighty like Uncle
  Aurette&rsquo;s three-pounders. He didn&rsquo;t go naked about the seas after dark.
  Then come more, which I reckoned was Captain Giddens in the Revenue cutter. He was
  open-handed with his compliments, but he <i>would</i> lay his guns himself. I stopped
  fiddling to listen, and I heard a whole skyful o&rsquo; French up in the fog&mdash;and
  a high bow come down on top o&rsquo; the smack. I hadn&rsquo;t time to call or think. I
  remember the smack heeling over, and me standing on the gunwale pushing against the
  ship&rsquo;s side as if I hoped to bear her off. Then the square of an open port, with
  a lantern in it, slid by in front of my nose. I kicked back on our gunwale as it went
  under and slipped through that port into the French ship&mdash;me and my
  fiddle.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Gracious!&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;What an adventure!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t anybody see you come in?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any one there. I&rsquo;d made use of an orlop-deck
  port&mdash;that&rsquo;s the next deck below the gun-deck, which by rights should not
  have been open at all. The crew was standing by their guns up above. I rolled on to a
  pile of dunnage in the dark and I went to sleep. When I woke, men was talking all round
  me, telling each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg
  153]</a></span> other their names and sorrows just like Dad told me pressed men used to
  talk in the last war. Pretty soon I made out they&rsquo;d all been hove aboard together
  by the press-gangs, and left to sort &rsquo;emselves. The ship she was the
  <i>Embuscade</i>, a thirty-six gun Republican frigate, Captain Jean Baptiste Bompard,
  two days out of Le Havre, going to the United States with a Republican French
  Ambassador of the name of Gen&ecirc;t. They had been up all night clearing for action
  on account of hearing guns in the fog. Uncle Aurette and Captain Giddens must have been
  passing the time o&rsquo; day with each other off Newhaven, and the frigate had drifted
  past &rsquo;em. She never knew she&rsquo;d run down our smack. Seeing so many aboard
  was total strangers to each other, I thought one more mightn&rsquo;t be noticed; so I
  put Aunt Cecile&rsquo;s red cap on the back of my head, and my hands in my pockets like
  the rest, and, as we French say, I circulated till I found the galley.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What! Here&rsquo;s one of &rsquo;em that isn&rsquo;t sick!&rdquo; says
  a cook. &ldquo;Take his breakfast to Citizen Bompard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I carried the tray to the cabin, but I didn&rsquo;t call this Bompard
  "Citizen.&rdquo; Oh no! &ldquo;Mon Capitaine&rdquo; was my little word, same as Uncle
  Aurette used to answer in King Louis&rsquo; Navy. Bompard, he liked it; he took me on
  for cabin servant, and after that no one asked questions; and thus I got good victuals
  and light work all the way across to America. He talked a heap of politics, and so did
  his officers, and when this Ambassador Gen&ecirc;t got rid of his land-stomach and laid
  down the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
  after dinner, a rook&rsquo;s parliament was nothing compared to their cabin. I learned
  to know most of the men which had worked the French Revolution, through waiting at
  table and hearing talk about &rsquo;em. One of our forecas&rsquo;le six-pounders was
  called Danton and t&rsquo;other Marat. I used to play the fiddle between &rsquo;em,
  sitting on the capstan. Day in and day out Bompard and Monsieur Gen&ecirc;t talked
  o&rsquo; what France had done, and how the United States was going to join her to
  finish off the English in this war. Monsieur Gen&ecirc;t said he&rsquo;d justabout make
  the United States fight for France. He was a rude common man. But I liked listening. I
  always helped drink any healths that was proposed&mdash;specially Citizen
  Danton&rsquo;s who&rsquo;d cut off King Louis&rsquo; head. An all-Englishman might have
  been shocked&mdash;that&rsquo;s where my French blood saved me.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t save me from getting a dose of ship&rsquo;s fever though, the
  week before we put Monsieur Gen&ecirc;t ashore at Charleston; and what was left of me
  after bleeding and pills took the dumb horrors from living &rsquo;tween decks. The
  surgeon, Karaguen his name was, kept me down there to help him with his
  plasters&mdash;I was too weak to wait on Bompard. I don&rsquo;t remember much of any
  account for the next few weeks, till I smelled lilacs, and I looked out of the port,
  and we was moored to a wharf-edge and there was a town o&rsquo; fine gardens and
  red-brick houses and all the green leaves in God&rsquo;s world waiting for me
  outside.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; I said to the sick-bay man&mdash;old Pierre
  Tiphaigne he was. "Philadelphia,&rdquo; says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155"
  id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> Pierre. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve missed it all.
  We&rsquo;re sailing next week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I just turned round and cried for longing to be amongst the laylocks.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s your trouble,&rdquo; says old Pierre, &ldquo;you go
  straight ashore. None&rsquo;ll hinder you. They&rsquo;re all gone mad on these
  coasts&mdash;French and American together. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> notion
  o&rsquo; war.&rdquo; Pierre was an old King Louis man.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;My legs was pretty tottly, but I made shift to go on deck, which it was like
  a fair. The frigate was crowded with fine gentlemen and ladies pouring in and out. They
  sung and they waved French flags, while Captain Bompard and his officers&mdash;yes, and
  some of the men&mdash;speechified to all and sundry about war with England. They
  shouted, &ldquo;Down with England!"&mdash;"Down with Washington!"&mdash;"Hurrah for
  France and the Republic!&rdquo; <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. I wanted to
  get out from that crunch of swords and petticoats and sit in a field. One of the
  gentlemen said to me, &ldquo;Is that a genuine cap o&rsquo; Liberty you&rsquo;re
  wearing?&rdquo; &lsquo;Twas Aunt Cecile&rsquo;s red one, and pretty near wore out.
  &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; I says, "straight from France.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
  a shilling for it,&rdquo; he says, and with that money in my hand and my fiddle under
  my arm I squeezed past the entry-port and went ashore. It was like a
  dream&mdash;meadows, trees, flowers, birds, houses, and people <i>all</i> different! I
  sat me down in a meadow and fiddled a bit, and then I went in and out the streets,
  looking and smelling and touching, like a little dog at a fair. Fine folk was setting
  on the white stone doorsteps of their houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
  id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> and a girl threw me a handful of laylock sprays, and
  when I said &ldquo;Merci" without thinking, she said she loved the French. They was all
  the fashion in the city. I saw more tricolour flags in Philadelphia than ever I&rsquo;d
  seen in Boulogne, and every one was shouting for war with England. A crowd o&rsquo;
  folk was cheering after our French ambassador&mdash;that same Monsieur Gen&ecirc;t
  which we&rsquo;d left at Charleston. He was a-horseback behaving as if the place
  belonged to him&mdash;and commanding all and sundry to fight the British. But I&rsquo;d
  heard that before. I got into a long straight street as wide as the Broyle, where
  gentlemen was racing horses. I&rsquo;m fond o&rsquo; horses. Nobody hindered &rsquo;em,
  and a man told me it was called Race Street o&rsquo; purpose for that. Then I followed
  some black niggers, which I&rsquo;d never seen close before; but I left them to run
  after a great, proud, copper-faced man with feathers in his hair and a red blanket
  trailing behind him. A man told me he was a real Red Indian called Red Jacket, and I
  followed him into an alley-way off Race Street by Second Street, where there was a
  fiddle playing. I&rsquo;m fond o&rsquo; fiddling. The Indian stopped at a baker&rsquo;s
  shop&mdash;Conrad Gerhard&rsquo;s it was&mdash;and bought some sugary cakes. Hearing
  what the price was I was going to have some too, but the Indian asked me in English if
  I was hungry. &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; I says. I must have looked a sore scrattel. He
  opens a door on to a staircase and leads the way up. We walked into a dirty little room
  full of flutes and fiddles and a fat man fiddling by the window, in a smell of cheese
  and medicines fit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg
  157]</a></span> knock you down. I <i>was</i> knocked down too, for the fat man jumped
  up and hit me a smack in the face. I fell against an old spinet covered with pill-boxes
  and the pills rolled about the floor. The Indian never moved an eyelid.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pick up the pills! Pick up the pills!&rdquo; the fat man
  screeches.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I started picking &rsquo;em up&mdash;hundreds of &rsquo;em&mdash;meaning to
  run out under the Indian&rsquo;s arm, but I came on giddy all over and I sat down. The
  fat man went back to his fiddling.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Toby!&rdquo; says the Indian after quite a while. &ldquo;I brought the
  boy to be fed, not hit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; says Toby, &ldquo;I thought it was Gert
  Schwankfelder.&rdquo; He put down his fiddle and took a good look at me.
  &ldquo;Himmel!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I have hit the wrong boy. It is not the new boy.
  Why are you not the new boy? Why are you not Gert Schwankfelder?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The gentleman in the pink
  blanket brought me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Says the Indian, &ldquo;He is hungry, Toby. Christians always feed the
  hungry. So I bring him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You should have said that first,&rdquo; said Toby. He pushed plates at
  me and the Indian put bread and pork on them, and a glass of Madeira wine. I told him I
  was off the French ship, which I had joined on account of my mother being French. That
  was true enough when you think of it, and besides I saw that the French was all the
  fashion in Philadelphia. Toby and the Indian whispered and I went on picking up the
  pills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You like pills&mdash;eh?&rdquo; says Toby.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen our ship&rsquo;s doctor roll
  too many of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; he says, and he shoves two bottles at me.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s those?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Calomel,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;And t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s
  senna.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One week have I tried to teach Gert
  Schwankfelder the difference between them, yet he cannot tell. You like to
  fiddle?&rdquo; he says. He&rsquo;d just seen my kit on the floor.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; says I.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What note is this?&rdquo; drawing his bow
  acrost.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He meant it for A, so I told him it was.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; he says to the Indian. &ldquo;I think this is the
  hand of Providence! I warned that Gert if he went to play upon the wharves any more he
  would hear from me. Now look at this boy and say what you think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Indian looked me over whole minutes&mdash;there was a musical clock on
  the wall and dolls came out and hopped while the hour struck. He looked me over all the
  while they did it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he says at last. &ldquo;This boy is good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good, then,&rdquo; says Toby. &ldquo;Now I shall play my fiddle and
  you shall sing your hymn, brother. Boy, go down to the bakery and tell them you are
  young Gert Schwankfelder that was. The horses are in Davy Jones&rsquo;s locker. If you
  ask any questions you shall hear from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I left &rsquo;em singing hymns and I went down to old Conrad Gerhard. He
  wasn&rsquo;t at all surprised when I told him I was young Gert
  Schwankfelder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
  that was. He knew Toby. His wife she walked me into the back yard without a word, and
  she washed me and she cut my hair to the edge of a basin, and she put me to bed, and
  Oh! how I slept&mdash;how I slept in that little room behind the oven looking on the
  flower garden! I didn&rsquo;t know Toby went to the <i>Embuscade</i> that night and
  bought me off Dr. Karaguen for twelve dollars and a dozen bottles of Seneca Oil.
  Karaguen wanted a new lace to his coat, and he reckoned I hadn&rsquo;t long to live; so
  he put me down as &ldquo;discharged sick."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I like Toby,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Who was he?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Apothecary Tobias Hirte,&rsquo; Pharaoh replied. &lsquo;One Hundred and
  Eighteen, Second Street&mdash;the famous Seneca Oil man, that lived half of every year
  among the Indians. But let me tell my tale my own way, same as his brown mare used to
  go to Lebanon.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then why did he keep her in Davy Jones&rsquo;s locker?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That was his joke. He kept her under David Jones&rsquo;s hat shop in the
  "Buck&rdquo; tavern yard, and his Indian friends kept their ponies there when they
  visited him. I looked after the horses when I wasn&rsquo;t rolling pills on top of the
  old spinet, while he played his fiddle and Red Jacket sang hymns. I liked it. I had
  good victuals, light work, a suit o&rsquo; clean clothes, a plenty music, and quiet,
  smiling German folk all around that let me sit in their gardens. My first Sunday, Toby
  took me to his church in Moravian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id=
  "Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> Alley; and that was in a garden too. The women wore
  long-eared caps and handkerchiefs. They came in at one door and the men at another, and
  there was a brass chandelier you could see your face in, and a nigger-boy to blow the
  organ bellows. I carried Toby&rsquo;s fiddle, and he played pretty much as he chose all
  against the organ and the singing. He was the only one they let do it, for they was a
  simple-minded folk. They used to wash each other&rsquo;s feet up in the attic to keep
  &rsquo;emselves humble: which Lord knows they didn&rsquo;t need.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How very queer,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>Pharaoh&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve met many and seen much,&rsquo; he
  said; &lsquo;but I haven&rsquo;t yet found any better or quieter or forbearinger people
  than the Brethren and Sistern of the Moravian Church in Philadelphia. Nor will I ever
  forget my first Sunday&mdash;the service was in English that week&mdash;with the smell
  of the flowers coming in from Pastor Meder&rsquo;s garden where the big peach tree is,
  and me looking at all the clean strangeness and thinking of &rsquo;tween decks on the
  <i>Embuscade</i> only six days ago. Being a boy, it seemed to me it had lasted for
  ever, and was going on for ever. But I didn&rsquo;t know Toby then. As soon as the
  dancing clock struck midnight that Sunday&mdash;I was lying under the spinet&mdash;I
  heard Toby&rsquo;s fiddle. He&rsquo;d just done his supper, which he always took late
  and heavy. "Gert,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;get the horses. Liberty and Independence for
  ever! The flowers appear upon the earth and the time of the singing of birds is come.
  We are going to my country seat in Lebanon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161"
  id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I rubbed my eyes, and fetched &rsquo;em out of the &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; stable.
  Red Jacket was there saddling his, and when I&rsquo;d packed the saddle-bags we three
  rode up Race Street to the Ferry by starlight. So we went travelling. It&rsquo;s a
  kindly, softly country there, back of Philadelphia among the German towns, Lancaster
  way. Little houses and bursting big barns, fat cattle, fat women, and all as peaceful
  as Heaven might be if they farmed there. Toby sold medicines out of his saddle-bags,
  and gave the French war-news to folk along the roads. Him and his long-hilted umberell
  was as well known as the stage coaches. He took orders for that famous Seneca Oil which
  he had the secret of from Red Jacket&rsquo;s Indians, and he slept in friend&rsquo;s
  farmhouses, but he <i>would</i> shut all the windows; so Red Jacket and me slept
  outside. There&rsquo;s nothing to hurt except snakes&mdash;and they slip away quick
  enough if you thrash in the bushes.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d have liked that!&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d no fault to find with those days. In the cool o&rsquo; the morning
  the cat-bird sings. He&rsquo;s something to listen to. And there&rsquo;s a smell of
  wild grape-vine growing in damp hollows which you drop into, after long rides in the
  heat, which is beyond compare for sweetness. So&rsquo;s the puffs out of the pine woods
  of afternoons. Come sundown, the frogs strike up, and later on the fireflies dance in
  the corn. Oh me, the fireflies in the corn! We were a week or ten days on the road,
  tacking from one place to another&mdash;such as Lancaster,
  Bethlehem-Ephrata&mdash;"thou Bethlehem-Ephrata"&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> odds&mdash;I loved the going about; and so
  we jogged into dozy little Lebanon by the Blue Mountains, where Toby had a cottage and
  a garden of all fruits. He come north every year for this wonderful Seneca Oil the
  Seneca Indians made for him. They&rsquo;d never sell to any one else, and he doctored
  &rsquo;em with von Swieten pills, which they valued more than their own oil. He could
  do what he chose with them, and, of course, he tried to make them Moravians. The
  Senecas are a seemly, quiet people, and they&rsquo;d had trouble enough from white
  men&mdash;Americans and English&mdash;during the wars, to keep &rsquo;em in that walk.
  They lived on a Reservation by themselves away off by their lake. Toby took me up
  there, and they treated me as if I was their own blood brother. Red Jacket said the
  mark of my bare feet in the dust was just like an Indian&rsquo;s and my style of
  walking was similar. I know I took to their ways all over.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Maybe the gipsy drop in your blood helped you?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Sometimes I think it did,&rsquo; Pharaoh went on. &lsquo;Anyhow Red Jacket
  and Cornplanter, the other Seneca chief, they let me be adopted into the tribe.
  It&rsquo;s only a compliment, of course, but Toby was angry when I showed up with my
  face painted. They gave me a side-name which means "Two Tongues,&rdquo; because,
  d&rsquo;ye see, I talked French and English.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They had their own opinions (<i>I</i>&rsquo;ve heard &rsquo;em) about the
  French and the English, <i>and</i> the Americans. They&rsquo;d suffered from all of
  &rsquo;em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
  during the wars, and they only wished to be left alone. But they thought a heap of the
  President of the United States. Cornplanter had had dealings with him in some French
  wars out West when General Washington was only a lad. His being President afterwards
  made no odds to &rsquo;em. They always called him Big Hand, for he was a large-fisted
  man, and he was all of their notion of a white chief. Cornplanter &rsquo;ud sweep his
  blanket round him, and after I&rsquo;d filled his pipe he&rsquo;d begin&mdash;"In the
  old days, long ago, when braves were many and blankets were few, Big Hand
  said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; If Red Jacket agreed to the say-so he&rsquo;d trickle a
  little smoke out of the corners of his mouth. If he didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d blow
  through his nostrils. Then Cornplanter &rsquo;ud stop and Red Jacket &rsquo;ud take on.
  Red Jacket was the better talker of the two. I&rsquo;ve laid and listened to &rsquo;em
  for hours. Oh! they knew General Washington well. Cornplanter used to meet him at
  Epply&rsquo;s&mdash;the great dancing place in the city before District Marshal William
  Nichols bought it. They told me he was always glad to see &rsquo;em, and he&rsquo;d
  hear &rsquo;em out to the end if they had anything on their minds. They had a good deal
  in those days. I came at it by degrees, after I was adopted into the tribe. The talk up
  in Lebanon and everywhere else that summer was about the French war with England and
  whether the United States &rsquo;ud join in with France or make a peace treaty with
  England. Toby wanted peace so as he could go about the Reservation buying his oils. But
  most of the white men wished for war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id=
  "Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> they was angry because the President wouldn&rsquo;t give
  the sign for it. The newspaper said men was burning Guy Fawke images of General
  Washington and yelling after him in the streets of Philadelphia. You&rsquo;d have been
  astonished what those two fine old chiefs knew of the ins and outs of such matters. The
  little I&rsquo;ve learned of politics I picked up from Cornplanter and Red Jacket on
  the Reservation. Toby used to read the <i>Aurora</i> newspaper. He was what they call a
  &ldquo;Democrat,&rdquo; though our Church is against the Brethren concerning themselves
  with politics.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I hate politics, too,&rsquo; said Una, and Pharaoh laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I might ha&rsquo; guessed it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But here&rsquo;s
  something that isn&rsquo;t politics. One hot evening late in August, Toby was reading
  the newspaper on the stoop and Red Jacket was smoking under a peach tree and I was
  fiddling. Of a sudden Toby drops his <i>Aurora</i>.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am an oldish man, too fond of my own comforts,&rdquo; he says.
  &ldquo;I will go to the church which is in Philadelphia. My brother, lend me a spare
  pony. I must be there to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; says Red Jacket looking at the sun. &ldquo;My brother
  shall be there. I will ride with him and bring back the ponies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I went to pack the saddle-bags. Toby had cured me of asking questions. He
  stopped my fiddling if I did. Besides, Indians don&rsquo;t ask questions much and I
  wanted to be like &rsquo;em.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When the horses were ready I jumped up.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get off,&rdquo; says Toby. &ldquo;Stay and mind the<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> cottage till I come
  back. The Lord has laid this on me, not on you&mdash;I wish he hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He powders off down the Lancaster road, and I sat on the door-step wondering
  after him. When I picked up the paper to wrap his fiddle-strings in, I spelled out a
  piece about the yellow fever being in Philadelphia so dreadful every one was running
  away. I was scared, for I was fond of Toby. We never said much to each other, but we
  fiddled together, and music&rsquo;s as good as talking to them that
  understand.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Did Toby die of yellow fever?&rsquo; Una asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not him! There&rsquo;s justice left in the world still. He went down to the
  City and bled &rsquo;em well again in heaps. He sent back word by Red Jacket that, if
  there was war or he died I was to bring the oils along to the city, but till then I was
  to go on working in the garden and Red Jacket was to see me do it. Down at heart all
  Indians reckon digging a squaw&rsquo;s business, and neither him nor Cornplanter, when
  he relieved watch, was a hard task-master. We hired a nigger-boy to do our work, and a
  lazy grinning runagate he was. When I found Toby didn&rsquo;t die the minute he reached
  town, why, boylike, I took him off my mind and went with my Indians again. Oh! those
  days up north at Canasedago, running races and gambling with the Senecas, or
  bee-hunting in the woods, or fishing in the lake.&rsquo; Pharaoh sighed and looked
  across the water. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s best,&rsquo; he went on suddenly, &lsquo;after
  the first frostes. You roll out o&rsquo; your blanket and find every leaf left green
  over night turned red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg
  166]</a></span> yellow, not by trees at a time, but hundreds and hundreds of miles of
  &rsquo;em, like sunsets splattered upside down. On one of such days&mdash;the maples
  was flaming scarlet and gold, and the sumach bushes were redder&mdash;Cornplanter and
  Red Jacket came out in full war-dress, making the very leaves look silly: feathered
  war-bonnets, yellow doe-skin leggings, fringed and tasselled, red horse-blankets, and
  their bridles feathered and shelled and beaded no bounds. I thought it was war against
  the British till I saw their faces weren&rsquo;t painted, and they only carried
  wrist-whips. Then I hummed &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo; at &rsquo;em. They told me they
  was going to visit Big Hand and find out for sure whether he meant to join the French
  in fighting the English or make a peace treaty with England. I reckon those two would
  ha&rsquo; gone out on the war-path at a nod from Big Hand, but they knew well, if there
  was war &rsquo;twixt England and the United States, their tribe &rsquo;ud catch it from
  both parties same as in all the other wars. They asked me to come along and hold the
  ponies. That puzzled me, because they always put their ponies up at the &ldquo;Buck" or
  Epply&rsquo;s when they went to see General Washington in the city, and horse-holding
  is a nigger&rsquo;s job. Besides, I wasn&rsquo;t exactly dressed for it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;you mean you were dressed like an Indian?&rsquo; Dan demanded.</p>

  <p>Pharaoh looked a little abashed. &lsquo;This didn&rsquo;t happen at Lebanon,&rsquo;
  he said, &lsquo;but a bit farther north, on the Reservation; and at that particular
  moment of time, so far as blanket, hair-band,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167"
  id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> moccasins, and sunburn went, there wasn&rsquo;t much
  odds &rsquo;twix me and a young Seneca buck. You may laugh,&rsquo; he smoothed down his
  long-skirted brown coat. &lsquo;But I told you I took to their ways all over. I said
  nothing, though I was bursting to let out the war-whoop like the young men had taught
  me.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, and you don&rsquo;t let out one here, either,&rsquo; said Puck before Dan
  could ask. &lsquo;Go on, Brother Square-toes.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We went on.&rsquo; Pharaoh&rsquo;s narrow dark eyes gleamed and danced.
  &lsquo;We went on&mdash;forty, fifty miles a day, for days on end&mdash;we three
  braves. And how a great tall Indian a-horseback can carry his war-bonnet at a canter
  through thick timber without brushing a feather beats <i>me</i>! My silly head was
  banged often enough by low branches, but they slipped through like running elks. We had
  evening hymn-singing every night after they&rsquo;d blown their pipe-smoke to the
  quarters of Heaven. Where did we go? I&rsquo;ll tell you, but don&rsquo;t blame me if
  you&rsquo;re no wiser. We took the old war-trail from the end of the Lake along the
  East Susquehanna through the Nantego country, right down to Fort Shamokin on the
  Senachse river. We crossed the Juniata by Fort Granville, got into Shippensberg over
  the hills by the Ochwick trail, and then to Williams Ferry (it&rsquo;s a bad one). From
  Williams Ferry, across the Shanedore, over the Blue Mountains, through Ashby&rsquo;s
  Gap, and so south-east by south from there, till we found the President at the back of
  his own plantations. I&rsquo;d hate to be trailed by Indians in earnest.
  They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> caught
  him like a partridge on a stump. After we&rsquo;d left our ponies, we scouted forward
  through a woody piece, and, creeping slower and slower, at last if my moccasins even
  slipped Red Jacket &rsquo;ud turn and frown. I heard voices&mdash;Monsieur
  Gen&ecirc;t&rsquo;s for choice&mdash;long before I saw anything, and we pulled up at
  the edge of a clearing where some niggers in grey and red liveries were holding horses,
  and half-a-dozen gentlemen&mdash;but one was Gen&ecirc;t&mdash;were talking among
  felled timber. I fancy they&rsquo;d come to see Gen&ecirc;t a piece on his road, for
  his portmantle was with him. I hid in between two logs as near to the company as I be
  to that old windlass there. I didn&rsquo;t need anybody to show me Big Hand. He stood
  up, very still, his legs a little apart, listening to Gen&ecirc;t, that French
  Ambassador, which never had more manners than a Bosham tinker. Gen&ecirc;t was as good
  as ordering him to declare war on England at once. I had heard that clack before on the
  <i>Embuscade</i>. He said he&rsquo;d stir up the whole United States to have war with
  England, whether Big Hand liked it or not.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Big Hand heard him out to the last end. I looked behind me and my two chiefs
  had vanished like smoke. Says Big Hand, &ldquo;That is very forcibly put, Monsieur
  Gen&ecirc;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Citizen&mdash;citizen!&rdquo; the fellow spits
  in. &ldquo;<i>I</i>, at least, am a Republican!&rdquo; &ldquo;Citizen
  Gen&ecirc;t,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you may be sure it will receive my fullest
  consideration.&rdquo; This seemed to take Citizen Gen&ecirc;t back a piece. He rode off
  grumbling, and never gave his nigger a penny. No gentleman!<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;The others all assembled round Big Hand then, and, in their way, they said
  pretty much what Gen&ecirc;t had said. They put it to him, here was France and England
  at war, in a manner of speaking, right across the United States&rsquo; stomach, and
  paying no regards to any one. The French was searching American ships on pretence they
  was helping England, but really for to steal the goods. The English was doing the same,
  only t&rsquo;other way round, and besides searching, they was pressing American
  citizens into their navy to help them fight France, on pretence that those Americans
  was lawful British subjects. His gentlemen put this very clear to Big Hand. It
  didn&rsquo;t look to <i>them</i>, they said, as though the United States trying to keep
  out of the fight was any advantage to <i>her</i>, because she only catched it from both
  French and English. They said that nine out of ten good Americans was crazy to fight
  the English then and there. They wouldn&rsquo;t say whether that was right or wrong;
  they only wanted Big Hand to turn it over in his mind. He did&mdash;for a while. I saw
  Red Jacket and Cornplanter watching him from the far side of the clearing, and how they
  had slipped round there was another mystery. Then Big Hand drew himself up, and he let
  his gentlemen have it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hit &rsquo;em?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, nor yet was it what you might call swearing. He&mdash;he blasted
  &rsquo;em with his natural speech. He asked them half-a-dozen times over whether the
  United States had enough armed ships for any shape or sort of war with any one. He
  asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
  &rsquo;em, if they thought she <i>had</i> those ships, to <i>give</i> him those ships,
  and they looked on the ground, as if they expected to find &rsquo;em <i>there</i>. He
  put it to &rsquo;em whether, setting ships aside, their country&mdash;I reckon he gave
  &rsquo;em good reasons&mdash;whether the United States was ready or able to face a new
  big war; she having but so few years back wound up one against England, and being all
  holds full of her own troubles. As I said, the strong way he laid it all before
  &rsquo;em blasted &rsquo;em, and when he&rsquo;d done it was like a still in the woods
  after a storm. A little man&mdash;but they all looked little&mdash;pipes up like a
  young rook in a blowed-down nest, &ldquo;Nevertheless, General, it seems you will be
  compelled to fight England.&rdquo; Quick Big Hand wheels on him, &ldquo;And is there
  anything in my past which makes you think I am averse to fighting Great
  Britain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Everybody laughed except him. &ldquo;Oh, General, you mistake us entirely!"
  they says. &ldquo;I trust so,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I know my duty. We <i>must</i>
  have peace with England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;At any price?&rdquo; says the man with the rook&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;At any price,&rdquo; says he word by word. &ldquo;Our ships will be
  searched&mdash;our citizens will be pressed, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then what about the Declaration of Independence?&rdquo; says one.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Deal with facts, not fancies,&rdquo; says Big Hand. &ldquo;The United
  States are in no position to fight England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But think of public opinion,&rdquo; another one<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> starts up. &ldquo;The
  feeling in Philadelphia alone is at fever heat.&rdquo;</p>

    <b>They made the sign which no Indian makes outside of the Medicine Lodges.--p. 171.</b>
  </div>

  <p>&lsquo;He held up one of his big hands. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he says&mdash;slow
  he spoke, but his voice carried far&mdash;"I have to think of our country. Let me
  assure you that the treaty with Great Britain will be made though every city in the
  Union burn me in effigy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;At any price?&rdquo; the actor-like chap keeps on croaking.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The treaty must be made on Great Britain&rsquo;s own terms. What else
  can I do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He turns his back on &rsquo;em and they looked at each other and slinked off
  to the horses, leaving him alone: and then I saw he was an old man. Then Red Jacket and
  Cornplanter rode down the clearing from the far end as though they had just chanced
  along. Back went Big Hand&rsquo;s shoulders, up went his head and he stepped forward
  one single pace with a great deep Hough! so pleased he was. That was a statelified
  meeting to behold&mdash;three big men, and two of &rsquo;em looking like jewelled
  images among the spattle of gay-coloured leaves. I saw my chiefs&rsquo; war-bonnets
  sinking together, down and down. Then they made the sign which no Indian makes outside
  of the Medicine Lodges&mdash;a sweep of the right hand just clear of the dust and an
  inbend of the left knee at the same time, and those proud eagle feathers almost touched
  his boot-top.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What did it mean?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mean!&rsquo; Pharaoh cried. &lsquo;Why it&rsquo;s what you&mdash;what
  we&mdash;it&rsquo;s the Sachems&rsquo; way of sprinkling<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> the sacred corn-meal in front of&mdash;oh!
  it&rsquo;s a piece of Indian compliment really, and it signifies that you are a very
  big chief.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Big Hand looked down on &rsquo;em. First he says quite softly, &ldquo;My
  brothers know it is not easy to be a chief.&rdquo; Then his voice grew. &ldquo;My
  children," says he, &ldquo;what is in your minds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Says Cornplanter, &ldquo;We came to ask whether there will be war with King
  George&rsquo;s men, but we have heard what our Father has said to his chiefs. We will
  carry away that talk in our hearts to tell to our people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Big Hand. &ldquo;Leave all that talk behind&mdash;it
  was between white men only&mdash;but take this message from <i>me</i> to your
  people&mdash;&lsquo;There will be no war.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;His gentlemen were waiting, so they didn&rsquo;t delay him; only Cornplanter
  says, using his old side-name, &ldquo;Big Hand, did you see us among the timber just
  now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;<i>You</i> taught me to look behind
  trees when we were both young.&rdquo; And with that he cantered off.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Neither of my chiefs spoke till we were back on our ponies again and a
  half-hour along the home-trail. Then Cornplanter says to Red Jacket, &ldquo;We will
  have the corn dance this year. There will be no war.&rdquo; And that was all there was
  to it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Pharaoh stood up as though he had finished.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Puck, rising too. &lsquo;And what came out of it in the long
  run?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Let me get at my story my own way,&rsquo; was the<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> answer. &lsquo;Look!
  it&rsquo;s later than I thought. That Shoreham smack&rsquo;s thinking of her
  supper.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The children looked across the darkening Channel. A smack had hoisted a lantern and
  slowly moved west where Brighton pier lights ran out in a twinkling line. When they
  turned round The Gap was empty behind them.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I expect they&rsquo;ve packed our trunks by now,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;This
  time to-morrow we&rsquo;ll be home.&rsquo;</p>

  <h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="A_Priest_in_Spite_of_Himself" id=
  "A_Priest_in_Spite_of_Himself"></a>&lsquo;A Priest in Spite of Himself&rsquo;</h2>

  <p>The day after they came home from the sea-side they set out on a tour of inspection
  to make sure everything was as they had left it. Soon they discovered that old Hobden
  had blocked their best hedge-gaps with stakes and thorn-bundles, and had trimmed up the
  hedges where the blackberries were setting.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be time for the gipsies to come along,&rsquo; said Una.
  &lsquo;Why, it was summer only the other day!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s smoke in Low Shaw!&rsquo; said Dan, sniffing.
  &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s make sure!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They crossed the fields towards the thin line of blue smoke that leaned above the
  hollow of Low Shaw which lies beside the King&rsquo;s Hill road. It used to be an old
  quarry till somebody planted it, and you can look straight down into it from the edge
  of Banky Meadow.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; Dan whispered, as they came up to the fence at the edge
  of the larches. A gipsy-van&mdash;not the showman&rsquo;s sort, but the old black kind,
  with little windows high up and a baby-gate across the door&mdash;was getting ready
  to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> leave. A
  man was harnessing the horses; an old woman crouched over the ashes of a fire made out
  of broken fence-rails; and a girl sat on the van-steps singing to a baby on her lap. A
  wise-looking, thin dog snuffed at a patch of fur on the ground till the old woman put
  it carefully in the middle of the fire. The girl reached back inside the van and tossed
  her a paper parcel. This was laid on the fire too, and they smelt singed feathers.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Chicken feathers!&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;I wonder if they are old
  Hobden&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Una sneezed. The dog growled and crawled to the girl&rsquo;s feet, the old woman
  fanned the fire with her hat, while the man led the horses up to the shafts. They all
  moved as quickly and quietly as snakes over moss.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the girl. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rsquo; She beat the
  dog, who seemed to expect it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; Una called down. &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his
  fault.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;How do you know what I&rsquo;m beating him for?&rsquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;For not seeing us,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;He was standing right in the
  smoke, and the wind was wrong for his nose, anyhow.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The girl stopped beating the dog and the old woman fanned faster than ever.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve fanned some of your feathers out of the fire,&rsquo; said Una.
  &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tail-feather by that chestnut-tot.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What of it?&rsquo; said the old woman, as she grabbed it.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing!&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;Only I&rsquo;ve heard say that
  tail-feathers are as bad as the whole bird, sometimes.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>That was a saying of Hobden&rsquo;s about pheasants. Old Hobden always burned all
  feather and fur before he sat down to eat.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Come on, mother,&rsquo; the man whispered. The old woman climbed into the van
  and the horses drew it out of the deep-rutted shaw on to the hard road.</p>

  <p>The girl waved her hands and shouted something they could not catch.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That was gipsy for &ldquo;Thank you kindly, Brother and Sister,"&rsquo; said
  Pharaoh Lee.</p>

  <p>He was standing behind them, his fiddle under his arm.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Gracious, you startled me!&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>You</i> startled old Priscilla Savile,&rsquo; Puck called from below them.
  &lsquo;Come and sit by their fire. She ought to have put it out before they
  left.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They dropped down the ferny side of the shaw. Una raked the ashes together, Dan
  found a dead wormy oak branch that burns without flame, and they watched the smoke
  while Pharaoh played a curious wavery air.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what the girl was humming to the baby,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; he nodded, and went on:</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;Ai Lumai, Lumai, Lumai! Luludia!</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Ai Luludia!&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>He passed from one odd tune to another, and quite forgot the children. At last Puck
  asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> him to
  go on with his adventures in Philadelphia and among the Seneca Indians.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m telling it,&rsquo; he said, staring straight in front of him as he
  played. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Maybe, but <i>they</i> can&rsquo;t. Tell it aloud,&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>Pharaoh shook himself, laid his fiddle beside him, and began:</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d left Red Jacket and Cornplanter riding home with me after Big Hand
  had said that there wouldn&rsquo;t be any war. That&rsquo;s all there was to it. We
  believed Big Hand and we went home again&mdash;we three braves. When we reached Lebanon
  we found Toby at the cottage with his waistcoat a foot too big for him&mdash;so hard he
  had worked amongst the yellow-fever people. He beat me for running off with the
  Indians, but &rsquo;twas worth it&mdash;I was glad to see him,&mdash;and when we went
  back to Philadelphia for the winter, and I was told how he&rsquo;d sacrificed himself
  over sick people in the yellow fever, I thought the world and all of him. No I
  didn&rsquo;t neither. I&rsquo;d thought that all along. That yellow fever must have
  been something dreadful. Even in December people had no more than begun to trinkle back
  to town. Whole houses stood empty and the niggers was robbing them out. But I
  can&rsquo;t call to mind that any of the Moravian Brethren had died. It seemed like
  they had just kept on with their own concerns, and the good Lord he&rsquo;d just looked
  after &rsquo;em. That was the winter&mdash;yes, winter of Ninety-three&mdash;the
  Brethren bought a stove for the Church. Toby spoke in favour of it because the cold
  spoiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> his
  fiddle hand, but many thought stove-heat not in the Bible, and there was yet a third
  party which always brought hickory coal foot-warmers to service and wouldn&rsquo;t
  speak either way. They ended by casting the Lot for it, which is like pitch and toss.
  After my summer with the Senecas, church-stoves didn&rsquo;t highly interest me, so I
  took to haunting round among the French <i>emigr&eacute;s</i> which Philadelphia was
  full of. My French and my fiddling helped me there, d&rsquo;ye see. They come over in
  shiploads from France, where, by what I made out, every one was killing every one else
  by any means, and they spread &rsquo;emselves about the city&mdash;mostly in
  Drinker&rsquo;s Alley and Elfrith&rsquo;s Alley&mdash;and they did odd jobs till times
  should mend. But whatever they stooped to, they were gentry and kept a cheerful
  countenance, and after an evening&rsquo;s fiddling at one of their poor little proud
  parties, the Brethren seemed old-fashioned. Pastor Meder and Brother Adam Goose
  didn&rsquo;t like my fiddling for hire, but Toby said it was lawful in me to earn my
  living by exercising my talents. He never let me be put upon.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;In February of Ninety-four&mdash;No, March it must have been, because a new
  ambassador called Fauchet had come from France, with no more manners than Gen&ecirc;t
  the old one&mdash;in March, Red Jacket came in from the Reservation bringing news of
  all kind friends there. I showed him round the city, and we saw General Washington
  riding through a crowd of folk that shouted for war with England. They gave him quite
  rough music, but he looked &rsquo;twixt his horse&rsquo;s ears and<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> made out not to notice.
  His stirrup brished Red Jacket&rsquo;s elbow, and Red Jacket whispered up, &ldquo;My
  brother knows it is not easy to be a chief?" Big Hand shot just one look at him and
  nodded. Then there was a scuffle behind us over some one who wasn&rsquo;t hooting at
  Washington loud enough to please the people. We went away to be out of the fight.
  Indians won&rsquo;t risk being hit.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What do they do if they are?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Kill, of course. That&rsquo;s why they have such proper manners. Well, then,
  coming home by Drinker&rsquo;s Alley to get a new shirt which a French Vicomte&rsquo;s
  lady was washing to take the stiff out of (I&rsquo;m always choice in my body-linen) a
  lame Frenchman pushes a paper of buttons at us. He hadn&rsquo;t long landed in the
  United States, and please would we buy. He sure-ly was a pitiful scrattel&mdash;his
  coat half torn off, his face cut, but his hands steady; so I knew it wasn&rsquo;t
  drink. He said his name was Peringuey, and he&rsquo;d been knocked about in the crowd
  round the Stadt&mdash;Independence Hall. One thing leading to another we took him up to
  Toby&rsquo;s rooms, same as Red Jacket had taken me the year before. The compliments he
  paid to Toby&rsquo;s Madeira wine fairly conquered the old man, for he opened a second
  bottle and he told this Monsieur Peringuey all about our great stove dispute in the
  Church. I remember Pastor Meder and Brother Adam Goose dropped in, and although they
  and Toby were direct opposite sides regarding stoves, yet this Monsieur Peringuey he
  made &rsquo;em feel as if he thought each one was in the right of it. He said he had
  been a clergyman before he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id=
  "Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> leave France. He admired at Toby&rsquo;s fiddling, and
  he asked if Red Jacket, sitting by the spinet, was a simple Huron. Senecas aren&rsquo;t
  Hurons, they&rsquo;re Iroquois, of course, and Toby told him so. Well, then, in due
  time he arose and left in a style which made us feel he&rsquo;d been favouring us,
  instead of us feeding him. I&rsquo;ve never seen that so strong before&mdash;in a man.
  We all talked him over but couldn&rsquo;t make head or tail of him, and Red Jacket come
  out to walk with me to the French quarter when I was due to fiddle at a party. Passing
  Drinker&rsquo;s Alley again we saw a naked window with a light in it, and there sat our
  button-selling Monsieur Peringuey throwing dice all alone, right hand against left.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Says Red Jacket, keeping back in the dark, &ldquo;Look at his
  face!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was looking. I protest to you I wasn&rsquo;t frightened like I was when Big
  Hand talked to his gentlemen. I&mdash;I only looked, and I only wondered that even
  those dead dumb dice &rsquo;ud dare to fall different from what that face wished.
  It&mdash;it <i>was</i> a face!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He is bad,&rdquo; says Red Jacket. &ldquo;But he is a great chief. The
  French have sent away a great chief. I thought so when he told us his lies. Now I
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I had to go on to the party, so I asked him to call round for me afterwards
  and we&rsquo;d have hymn-singing at Toby&rsquo;s as usual.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Tell Toby I am not Christian to-night. All
  Indian.&rdquo; He had those fits sometimes. I wanted to know more about Monsieur
  Peringuey, and the <i>emigr&eacute;</i> party was the<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> very place to find out. It&rsquo;s neither
  here nor there of course, but those French <i>emigr&eacute;</i> parties they almost
  make you cry. The men that you bought fruit of in Market Street, the hairdressers and
  fencing-masters and French teachers, they turn back again by candlelight to what they
  used to be at home, and you catch their real names. There wasn&rsquo;t much room in the
  wash-house, so I sat on top of the copper and played &rsquo;em the tunes they called
  for&mdash;"<i>Si le Roi m&rsquo;avait donn&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; and such nursery stuff.
  They cried sometimes. It hurt me to take their money afterwards, indeed it did. And
  there I found out about Monsieur Peringuey. He was a proper rogue too! None of
  &rsquo;em had a good word for him except the Marquise that kept the French
  boarding-house on Fourth Street. I made out that his real name was the Count Talleyrand
  de P&eacute;rigord&mdash;a priest right enough, but sorely come down in the world.
  He&rsquo;d been King Louis&rsquo; ambassador to England a year or two back, before the
  French had cut off King Louis&rsquo; head; and, by what I heard, that head wasn&rsquo;t
  hardly more than hanging loose before he&rsquo;d run back to Paris and prevailed on
  Danton, the very man which did the murder, to send him back to England again as
  Ambassador of the French Republic! That was too much for the English, so they kicked
  him out by Act of Parliament, and he&rsquo;d fled to the Americas without money or
  friends or prospects. I&rsquo;m telling you the talk in the wash-house. Some of
  &rsquo;em was laughing over it. Says the French Marquise, &ldquo;My friends, you laugh
  too soon. That man will be on the winning side before any of us."<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I did not know you were so fond of priests, Marquise,&rdquo; says the
  Vicomte. His lady did my washing, as I&rsquo;ve told you.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I have my reasons,&rdquo; says the Marquise. &ldquo;He sent my uncle
  and my two brothers to Heaven by the little door,"&mdash;that was one of the
  <i>emigr&eacute;</i> names for the guillotine. &ldquo;He will be on the winning side if
  it costs him the blood of every friend he has in the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then what does he want here?&rdquo; says one of &rsquo;em. &ldquo;We
  have all lost our game.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My faith!&rdquo; says the Marquise. &ldquo;He will find out, if any
  one can, whether this canaille of a Washington means to help us to fight England.
  Gen&ecirc;t (that was my ambassador in the <i>Embuscade</i>) has failed and gone off
  disgraced; Fauchet (he was the new man) hasn&rsquo;t done any better, but our
  abb&eacute; will find out, and he will make his profit out of the news. Such a man does
  not fail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He begins unluckily,&rdquo; says the Vicomte. &ldquo;He was set upon
  to-day in the street for not hooting your Washington.&rdquo;They all laughed again, and
  one remarks, &ldquo;How does the poor devil keep himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He must have slipped in through the wash-house door, for he flits past me and
  joins &rsquo;em, cold as ice.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;One does what one can,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I sell buttons. And you,
  Marquise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I?"&mdash;she waves her poor white hands all burned&mdash;"I am a
  cook&mdash;a very bad one&mdash;at your service, abb&eacute;. We were just talking
  about you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg
  190]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;They didn&rsquo;t treat him like they talked of him. They backed off and
  stood still.</p>

  <p>"&lsquo;I have missed something then,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I spent this last
  hour playing&mdash;only for buttons, Marquise&mdash;against a noble savage, the
  veritable Huron himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You had your usual luck, I hope?&rdquo; she says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I cannot afford to lose even buttons
  in these days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then I suppose the child of nature does not know that your dice are
  usually loaded, Father Tout-a-tous,&rdquo; she continues. I don&rsquo;t know whether
  she meant to accuse him of cheating. He only bows.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not yet, Mademoiselle Cunegonde,&rdquo; he says, and goes on to make
  himself agreeable to the rest of the company. And that was how I found out our Monsieur
  Peringuey was Count Charles Maurice Talleyrand de P&eacute;rigord.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Pharaoh stopped, but the children said nothing.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of him?&rsquo; said Pharaoh.</p>

  <p>Una shook her head.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Was Red Jacket the Indian he played dice with?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He was. Red Jacket told me the next time we met. I asked if the lame man had
  cheated. Red Jacket said no&mdash;he had played quite fair and was a master player. I
  allow Red Jacket knew. I&rsquo;ve seen him, on the Reservation, play himself out of
  everything he had and in again. Then I told Red Jacket all I&rsquo;d heard at the party
  concerning Talleyrand.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I saw the man&rsquo;s
  war-face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> when
  he thought he was alone. That is why I played him. I played him face to face. He is a
  great chief. Do they say why he comes here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They say he comes to find out if Big Hand makes war against the
  English,&rdquo;I said.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Red Jacket grunted. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He asked me that too.
  If he had been a small chief I should have lied. But he is a great chief. He knew I was
  a chief, so I told him the truth. I told him what Big Hand said to Cornplanter and me
  in the clearing&mdash;&lsquo;There will be no war.&rsquo; I could not see what he
  thought. I could not see behind his face. But he is a great chief. He will
  believe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Will he believe that Big Hand can keep his people back from
  war?&rdquo;I said, thinking of the crowds that hooted Big Hand whenever he rode
  out.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He is as bad as Big Hand is good, but he is not as strong as Big
  Hand,&rdquo; says Red Jacket. &ldquo;When he talks with Big Hand he will feel this in
  his heart. The French have sent away a great chief. Presently he will go back and make
  them afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now wasn&rsquo;t that comical? The French woman that knew him and owed all
  her losses to him; the Indian that picked him up, cut and muddy on the street and
  played dice with him; they neither of &rsquo;em doubted that Talleyrand was something
  by himself&mdash;appearances notwithstanding.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And was he something by himself?&rsquo; asked Una.</p>

  <p>Pharaoh began to laugh, but stopped. &lsquo;The way <i>I</i> look at it,&rsquo; he
  said, &lsquo;Talleyrand was one of just three men in this world who are quite
  by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
  themselves. Big Hand I put first, because I&rsquo;ve seen him.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we lost him out of Old England.
  Who d&rsquo;you put second?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Talleyrand: maybe because I&rsquo;ve seen him too,&rsquo; said Pharaoh.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s third?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Boney&mdash;even though I&rsquo;ve seen him.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;Every man has his own weights and measures,
  but that&rsquo;s queer reckoning.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Boney?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve ever met
  Napoleon Bonaparte?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There, I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t have patience with the rest of my tale after
  hearing that! But wait a minute. Talleyrand he come round to Hundred and Eighteen in a
  day or two to thank Toby for his kindness. I didn&rsquo;t mention the dice-playing, but
  I could see that Red Jacket&rsquo;s doings had made Talleyrand highly curious about
  Indians&mdash;though he would call him the Huron. Toby, as you may believe, was all
  holds full of knowledge concerning their manners and habits. He only needed a listener.
  The Brethren don&rsquo;t study Indians much till they join the church, but Toby knew
  &rsquo;em wild. So evening after evening Talleyrand crossed his sound leg over his game
  one and Toby poured forth. Having been adopted into the Senecas I, naturally, kept
  still, but Toby &rsquo;ud call on me to back up some of his remarks, and by that means,
  and a habit he had of drawing you on in talk, Talleyrand saw I knew something of his
  noble savages too. Then he tried a trick. Coming back from an <i>emigr&eacute;</i>
  party he turns into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg
  193]</a></span> his little shop and puts it to me, laughing like, that I&rsquo;d gone
  with the two chiefs on their visit to Big Hand. <i>I</i> hadn&rsquo;t told. Red Jacket
  hadn&rsquo;t told, and Toby, of course, didn&rsquo;t know. &lsquo;Twas just
  Talleyrand&rsquo;s guess. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;my English and Red
  Jacket&rsquo;s French was so bad that I am not sure I got the rights of what the
  President really said to the unsophisticated Huron. Do me the favour of telling it
  again.&rdquo;I told him every word Red Jacket had told him and not one word more. I had
  my suspicions, having just come from an <i>emigr&eacute;</i> party where the Marquise
  was hating and praising him as usual.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t gather from
  Red Jacket exactly what the President said to Monsieur Gen&ecirc;t, or to his American
  gentlemen after Monsieur Gen&ecirc;t had ridden away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I saw Talleyrand was guessing again, for Red Jacket hadn&rsquo;t told him a
  word about the white man&rsquo;s pow-wow.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why hadn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; Puck asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Because Red Jacket was a chief. He told Talleyrand what the President had
  said to him and Cornplanter; but he didn&rsquo;t repeat the talk, between the white
  men, that Big Hand ordered him to leave behind.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;I see. What did <i>you</i> do?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;First I was going to make some sort of tale round it, but Talleyrand was a
  chief too. So I said, &ldquo;As soon as I get Red Jacket&rsquo;s permission to tell
  that part of the tale, I&rsquo;ll be delighted to refresh your memory,
  abb&eacute;.&rdquo;What else could I have done?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194"
  id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he says, laughing. &ldquo;Let me refresh your
  memory. In a month from now I can give you a hundred dollars for your account of the
  conversation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Make it five hundred, abb&eacute;,&rdquo;I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Five, then,&rdquo; says he.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That will suit me admirably,&rdquo;I says. &ldquo;Red Jacket will be
  in town again by then, and the moment he gives me leave I&rsquo;ll claim the
  money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He had a hard fight to be civil but he come out smiling.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I beg your pardon as sincerely as I
  envy the noble Huron your loyalty. Do me the honour to sit down while I
  explain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There wasn&rsquo;t another chair, so I sat on the button-box.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He was a clever man. He had got hold of the gossip that the President meant
  to make a peace treaty with England at any cost. He had found out&mdash;from
  Gen&ecirc;t, I reckon, who was with the President on the day the two chiefs met him.
  He&rsquo;d heard that Gen&ecirc;t had had a huff with the President and had ridden off
  leaving his business at loose ends. What he wanted&mdash;what he begged and blustered
  to know&mdash;was just the very words which the President had said to his gentlemen
  <i>after</i> Gen&ecirc;t had left, concerning the peace treaty with England. He put it
  to me that in helping him to those very words I&rsquo;d be helping three great
  countries as well as mankind. The room was as bare as the palm of your hand, but I
  couldn&rsquo;t laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg
  195]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;I says, when he wiped his forehead. &ldquo;As
  soon as Red Jacket gives permission&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me, then?&rdquo; he cuts in.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not one little, little word, abb&eacute;,&rdquo;I says; &ldquo;except
  that you mean to be on the winning side. Remember, I&rsquo;ve been fiddling to all your
  old friends for months.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, his temper fled him and he called me names.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Wait a minute, ci-devant,&rdquo;I says at last. &ldquo;I <i>am</i>
  half English and half French, but I am not the half of a man. I will tell thee
  something the Indian told me. Has thee seen the President?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; he sneers, &ldquo;I had letters from the Lord Lansdowne
  to that estimable old man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;I says, &ldquo;thee will understand. The Red Skin said
  that when thee has met the President thee will feel in thy heart he is a stronger man
  than thee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he whispers. &ldquo;Before I kill thee, go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He looked like it. So I left him.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why did he want to know so badly?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The way I look at it is that if he <i>had</i> known for certain that
  Washington meant to make the peace treaty with England at any price, he&rsquo;d
  ha&rsquo; left old Fauchet fumbling about in Philadelphia while he went straight back
  to France and told old Danton&mdash;"It&rsquo;s no good your wasting time and hopes on
  the United States, because she won&rsquo;t fight on our side&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve
  proof of!&rdquo;Then Danton might have been grateful and given Talleyrand a job,
  because a whole mass of things hang on knowing for sure who&rsquo;s your friend and
  who&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
  your enemy. Just think of us poor shopkeepers, for instance.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Did Red Jacket let you tell, when he came back?&rsquo; Una asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Of course not. He said, &ldquo;When Cornplanter and I ask you what Big Hand
  said to the whites you can tell the Lame Chief. All that talk was left behind in the
  timber, as Big Hand ordered. Tell the Lame Chief there will be no war. He can go back
  to France with that word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Talleyrand and me hadn&rsquo;t met for a long time except at
  <i>emigr&eacute;</i> parties. When I give him the message he just shook his head. He
  was sorting buttons in the shop.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I cannot return to France with nothing better than the word of an
  unsophisticated savage,&rdquo; he says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t the President said anything to you?&rdquo;I asked
  him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He has said everything that one in his position ought to say,
  but&mdash;but if only I had what he said to his Cabinet after Gen&ecirc;t rode off I
  believe I could change Europe&mdash;the world, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;I says. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll do that
  without my help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He looked at me hard. &ldquo;Either you have unusual observation for one so
  young, or you choose to be insolent,&rdquo; he says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It was intended for a compliment,&rdquo;I says. &ldquo;But no odds.
  We&rsquo;re off in a few days for our summer trip, and I&rsquo;ve come to make my
  good-byes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I go on my travels too,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If ever<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> we meet again you may be
  sure I will do my best to repay what I owe you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Without malice, abb&eacute;, I hope,&rdquo;I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Give my respects to your
  adorable Dr. Pangloss (that was one of his side-names for Toby) and the Huron.&rdquo;I
  never <i>could</i> teach him the difference betwixt Hurons and Senecas.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then Sister Haga came in for a paper of what we call &ldquo;pilly buttons,"
  and that was the last I saw of Talleyrand in those parts.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But after that you met Napoleon, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wait just a little, dearie. After that, Toby and I went to Lebanon and the
  Reservation, and, being older and knowing better how to manage him, I enjoyed myself
  well that summer with fiddling and fun. When we came back, the Brethren got after Toby
  because I wasn&rsquo;t learning any lawful trade, and he had hard work to save me from
  being apprenticed to Helmbold and Geyer the printers. &lsquo;Twould have ruined our
  music together, indeed it would; and when we escaped that, old Mattes Roush, the
  leather-breeches maker round the corner, took a notion I was cut out for skin-dressing.
  But we were rescued. Along towards Christmas there comes a big sealed letter from the
  Bank saying that a Monsieur Talleyrand had put five hundred dollars&mdash;a hundred
  pounds&mdash;to my credit there to use as I pleased. There was a little note from him
  inside&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t give any address&mdash;to thank me for past kindnesses and
  my believing in his future which he said was pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> cloudy at the time of writing. I wished
  Toby to share the money. <i>I</i> hadn&rsquo;t done more than bring Talleyrand up to
  Hundred and Eighteen. The kindnesses were Toby&rsquo;s. But Toby said, &ldquo;No!
  Liberty and Independence for ever. I have all my wants, my son.&rdquo;So I gave him a
  set of new fiddle-strings and the Brethren didn&rsquo;t advise us any more. Only Pastor
  Meder he preached about the deceitfulness of riches, and Brother Adam Goose said if
  there was war the English &rsquo;ud surely shoot down the Bank. <i>I</i> knew there
  wasn&rsquo;t going to be any war, but I drew the money out and on Red Jacket&rsquo;s
  advice I put it into horse-flesh, which I sold to Bob Bicknell for the Baltimore
  stage-coaches. That way, I doubled my money inside the twelvemonth.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You gipsy! You proper gipsy!&rsquo; Puck shouted.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why not? &lsquo;Twas fair buying and selling. Well, one thing leading to
  another, in a few years I had made the beginning of a worldly fortune and was in the
  tobacco trade.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Puck, suddenly. &lsquo;Might I inquire if you&rsquo;d ever
  sent any news to your people in England&mdash;or in France?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;O&rsquo; course I had. I wrote regular every three months after I&rsquo;d
  made money in the horse trade. We Lees don&rsquo;t like coming home empty-handed. If
  it&rsquo;s only a turnip or an egg, it&rsquo;s something. Oh yes, I wrote good and
  plenty to Uncle Aurette, and&mdash;Dad don&rsquo;t read very quickly&mdash;Uncle used
  to slip over Newhaven way and tell Dad what was going on in the tobacco
  trade.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg
  199]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">&lsquo;Aurettes and Lees&mdash;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Like as two peas.</span><br /></p>

  <p>Go on, Brother Square-toes,&rsquo; said Puck. Pharaoh laughed and went on.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Talleyrand he&rsquo;d gone up in the world same as me. He&rsquo;d sailed to
  France again, and was a great man in the Government there awhile, but they had to turn
  him out on account of some story about bribes from American shippers. All our poor
  <i>emigr&eacute;s</i> said he was surely finished this time, but Red Jacket and me we
  didn&rsquo;t think it likely, not unless he was quite dead. Big Hand had made his peace
  treaty with Great Britain, just <i>as</i> he said he would, and there was a roaring
  trade &rsquo;twixt England and the United States for such as &rsquo;ud take the risk of
  being searched by British and French men-of-wars. Those two was fighting, and just
  <i>as</i> his gentlemen told Big Hand &rsquo;ud happen&mdash;the United States was
  catching it from both. If an English man-o&rsquo;-war met an American ship he&rsquo;d
  press half the best men out of her, and swear they was British subjects. Most of
  &rsquo;em was! If a Frenchman met her he&rsquo;d, likely, have the cargo out of her,
  swearing it was meant to aid and comfort the English; and if a Spaniard or a Dutchman
  met her&mdash;they was hanging on to England&rsquo;s coat-tails too&mdash;Lord only
  knows what <i>they</i> wouldn&rsquo;t do! It came over me that what I wanted in my
  tobacco trade was a fast-sailing ship and a man who could be French, English, or
  American at a pinch. Luckily I could lay my hands on both articles. So along towards
  the end of September in the year &lsquo;99 I sailed from Philadelphia with a
  hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> and
  eleven hogshead o&rsquo; good Virginia tobacco, in the brig <i>Berthe Aurette</i> named
  after mother&rsquo;s maiden name, hoping &rsquo;twould bring me luck, which she
  didn&rsquo;t&mdash;and yet she did.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Where was you bound for?&rsquo; Puck asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Er&mdash;any port I found handiest. I didn&rsquo;t tell Toby or the Brethren.
  They don&rsquo;t understand the inns and outs of the tobacco trade.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Puck coughed a small cough as he shifted a piece of wood with his bare foot.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s easy for you to sit and judge,&rsquo; Pharaoh cried. &lsquo;But
  think o&rsquo; what <i>we</i> had to put up with! We spread our wings and run across
  the broad Atlantic like a hen through a horse-fair. Even so, we was stopped by an
  English frigate, three days out. He sent a boat alongside and pressed seven able
  seamen. I remarked it was hard on honest traders, but the officer said they was
  fighting all creation and hadn&rsquo;t time to argue. The next English frigate we
  escaped with no more than a shot in our quarter. Then we was chased two days and a
  night by a French privateer, firing between squalls, and the dirty little English
  ten-gun brig which made him sheer off had the impudence to press another five of our
  men. That&rsquo;s how we reached to the chops of the Channel. Twelve good men pressed
  out of thirty-five; an eighteen-pound shot-hole close besides our rudder; our mainsail
  looking like spectacles where the Frenchman had hit us&mdash;and the Channel crawling
  with short-handed British cruisers. Put <i>that</i> in your pipe and smoke it next time
  you grumble at the price of tobacco!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id=
  "Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, to top it off, while we was trying to get at our leaks, a French
  lugger come swooping at us out o&rsquo; the dusk. We warned him to keep away, but he
  fell aboard us, and up climbed his jabbering red-caps. We couldn&rsquo;t endure any
  more&mdash;indeed we couldn&rsquo;t. We went at &rsquo;em with all we could lay hands
  on. It didn&rsquo;t last long. They was fifty odd to our twenty-three. Pretty soon I
  heard the cutlasses thrown down and some one bellowed for the <i>sacr&eacute;</i>
  captain.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo;I says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it makes any
  odds to you thieves, but this is the United States brig <i>Berthe
  Aurette</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My aunt!&rdquo; the man says, laughing. &ldquo;Why is she named
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s speaking?&rdquo;I said. &lsquo;Twas too dark to see, but I
  thought I knew the voice.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Enseigne de Vaisseau Estephe L&rsquo;Estrange,&rdquo; he sings out,
  and then I was sure.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;I says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the family, I suppose, but
  you <i>have</i> done a fine day&rsquo;s work, Stephen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He whips out the binnacle-light and holds it to my face. He was young
  L&rsquo;Estrange, my full cousin, that I hadn&rsquo;t seen since the night the smack
  sank off Telscombe Tye&mdash;six years ago.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why she was named for Aunt
  Berthe, is it? What&rsquo;s your share in her, Pharaoh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Only half owner, but the cargo&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can, but
  you shouldn&rsquo;t have fought us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo;I says, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t ever going to<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> report our little
  fall-out as a fight! Why, a Revenue cutter &rsquo;ud laugh at it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;So&rsquo;d I if I wasn&rsquo;t in the Republican Navy,&rdquo; he says.
  &ldquo;But two of our men are dead, d&rsquo;ye see, and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll
  have to take you to the Prize Court at Le Havre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Will they condemn my &rsquo;baccy?&rdquo;I asks.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;To the last ounce. But I was thinking more of the ship. She&rsquo;d
  make a sweet little craft for the Navy if the Prize Court &rsquo;ud let me have her,"
  he says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then I knew there was no hope. I don&rsquo;t blame him&mdash;a man must
  consider his own interests&mdash;but nigh every dollar I had was in ship or cargo, and
  Steve kept on saying, &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have fought us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, the lugger took us to Le Havre, and that being the one time we
  <i>did</i> want a British ship to rescue us, why o&rsquo; course we never saw one. My
  cousin spoke his best for us at the Prize Court. He owned he&rsquo;d no right to rush
  alongside in the face o&rsquo; the United States flag, but we couldn&rsquo;t get over
  those two men killed, d&rsquo;ye see, and the Court condemned both ship and cargo. They
  was kind enough not to make us prisoners&mdash;only beggars&mdash;and young
  L&rsquo;Estrange was given the <i>Berthe Aurette</i> to re-arm into the French
  Navy.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you round to Boulogne,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Mother
  and the rest&rsquo;ll be glad to see you, and you can slip over to Newhaven with Uncle
  Aurette. Or you can ship with me, like most o&rsquo; your men, and have a turn at King
  George&rsquo;s loose trade. There&rsquo;s plenty pickings,&rdquo; he says.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Crazy as I was, I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my allowance of pickings and stealings,&rdquo;I says.
  &ldquo;Where are they taking my tobacco?&rdquo;&lsquo;Twas being loaded on to a
  barge.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Up the Seine to be sold in Paris,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Neither you
  nor I will ever touch a penny of that money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get me leave to go with it,&rdquo;I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if
  there&rsquo;s justice to be gotten out of our American Ambassador.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much justice in this world,&rdquo; he says,
  &ldquo;without a Navy." But he got me leave to go with the barge and he gave me some
  money. That tobacco was all I had, and I followed it like a hound follows a snatched
  bone. Going up the river I fiddled a little to keep my spirits up, as well as to make
  friends with the guard. They was only doing their duty. Outside o&rsquo; that they were
  the reasonablest o&rsquo; God&rsquo;s creatures. They never even laughed at me. So we
  come to Paris, by river; along in November, which the French had christened Brumaire.
  They&rsquo;d given new names to all the months, and after such an outrageous silly
  piece o&rsquo; business as <i>that</i>, they wasn&rsquo;t likely to trouble
  &rsquo;emselves with my rights and wrongs. They didn&rsquo;t. The barge was laid up
  below Notre Dame church in charge of a caretaker, and he let me sleep aboard after
  I&rsquo;d run about all day from office to office, seeking justice and fair dealing,
  and getting speeches concerning liberty. None heeded me. Looking back on it I
  can&rsquo;t rightly blame &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;d no money, my clothes was filthy mucked;
  I hadn&rsquo;t changed my linen in weeks, and I&rsquo;d no<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> proof of my claims
  except the ship&rsquo;s papers, which, they said, I might have stolen. The thieves! The
  doorkeeper to the American Ambassador&mdash;for I never saw even the Secretary&mdash;he
  swore I spoke French a sight too well for an American citizen. Worse than that&mdash;I
  had spent my money, d&rsquo;ye see, and I&mdash;I took to fiddling in the streets for
  my keep; and&mdash;and, a ship&rsquo;s captain with a fiddle under his arm&mdash;well,
  I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> blame &rsquo;em that they didn&rsquo;t believe me.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I come back to the barge one day&mdash;late in this month Brumaire it
  was&mdash;fair beazled out. Old Maingon, the caretaker, he&rsquo;d lit a fire in a
  bucket and was grilling a herring.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Courage, mon ami,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Dinner is served.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo;I says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do any more.
  It&rsquo;s stronger than I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s stronger than a man. Me,
  for example! Less than two years ago I was blown up in the <i>Orient</i> in Aboukir
  Bay, but I descended again and hit the water like a fairy. Look at me now,&rdquo; he
  says. He wasn&rsquo;t much to look at, for he&rsquo;d only one leg and one eye, but the
  cheerfullest soul that ever trod shoe-leather. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s worse than a hundred
  and eleven hogshead of &rsquo;baccy,&rdquo; he goes on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re young, too!
  What wouldn&rsquo;t I give to be young in France at this hour! There&rsquo;s nothing
  you couldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The ball&rsquo;s at your feet&mdash;kick
  it!&rdquo; he says. He kicks the old fire bucket with his peg-leg. &ldquo;General
  Buonaparte, for example!&rdquo; he goes on. &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s a babe<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> compared to me, and see
  what he&rsquo;s done already. He&rsquo;s conquered Egypt and Austria and
  Italy&mdash;oh! half Europe!&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and now he sails back to Paris, and
  he sails out to St. Cloud down the river here&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t</i> stare at the
  river, you young fool!&mdash;and all in front of these pig-jobbing lawyers and citizens
  he makes himself Consul, which is as good as a King. He&rsquo;ll <i>be</i> King, too,
  in the next three turns of the capstan&mdash;King of France, England, and the world!
  Think o&rsquo; that!&rdquo; he shouts, &ldquo;and eat your herring.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I says something about Boney. If he hadn&rsquo;t been fighting England I
  shouldn&rsquo;t have lost my &rsquo;baccy&mdash;should I?</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Young fellow,&rdquo; says Maingon, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
  understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We heard cheering. A carriage passed over the bridge with two in it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man himself,&rdquo; says Maingon. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
  give &rsquo;em something to cheer for soon.&rdquo; He stands at the salute.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other in black beside him?&rdquo; I asks, fairly
  shaking all over.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s the clever one. You&rsquo;ll hear of him before long.
  He&rsquo;s that scoundrel-bishop, Talleyrand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; I said, and up the steps I went with my fiddle, and run
  after the carriage calling, &ldquo;Abb&eacute;, abb&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A soldier knocked the wind out of me with the back of his sword, but I had
  sense to keep on following till the carriage stopped&mdash;and there just was a crowd
  round the house-door! I must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id=
  "Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> been half-crazy else I wouldn&rsquo;t have struck up
  &ldquo;<i>Si le Roi m&rsquo;avait donn&eacute;, Paris la grande ville!</i>&rdquo; I
  thought it might remind him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That is a good omen!&rdquo; he says to Boney sitting all hunched up;
  and he looks straight at me.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Abb&eacute;&mdash;oh, abb&eacute;!&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  you remember Toby and Hundred and Eighteen Second Street?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He said not a word. He just crooked his long white finger to the guard at the
  door while the carriage steps were let down, and I skipped into the house, and they
  slammed the door in the crowd&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You go there,&rdquo; says a soldier, and shoves me into an empty room,
  where I catched my first breath since I&rsquo;d left the barge. Presently I heard
  plates rattling next door&mdash;there were only folding doors between&mdash;and a cork
  drawn. &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; some one shouts with his mouth full, &ldquo;it was all
  that sulky ass Siey&egrave;s&rsquo; fault. Only my speech to the Five Hundred saved the
  situation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Did it save your coat?&rdquo; says Talleyrand. &ldquo;I hear they tore
  it when they threw you out. Don&rsquo;t gasconade to me. You may be in the road of
  victory, but you aren&rsquo;t there yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then I guessed t&rsquo;other man was Boney. He stamped about and swore at
  Talleyrand.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You forget yourself, Consul,&rdquo; says Talleyrand, &ldquo;or rather
  you remember yourself&mdash;Corsican.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pig!&rdquo; says Boney, and worse.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Emperor!&rdquo; says Talleyrand, but, the way he spoke, it sounded
  worst of all. Some one must have backed against the folding doors, for they<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> flew open and showed me
  in the middle of the room. Boney whipped out his pistol before I could stand up.
  &ldquo;General,&rdquo; says Talleyrand to him, &ldquo;this gentleman has a habit of
  catching us canaille <i>en d&eacute;shabill&eacute;</i>. Put that thing
  down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Boney laid it on the table, so I guessed which was master. Talleyrand takes
  my hand&mdash;"Charmed to see you again, Candide,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;How is the
  adorable Dr. Pangloss and the noble Huron?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They were doing very well when I left,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But
  I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Do <i>you</i> sell buttons now?&rdquo; he says, and fills me a glass
  of wine off the table.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Madeira,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Not so good as some I have
  drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You mountebank!&rdquo; Boney roars. &ldquo;Turn that out.&rdquo; (He
  didn&rsquo;t even say "man,&rdquo; but Talleyrand, being gentle born, just went
  on.)</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pheasant is not so good as pork,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You will find
  some at that table if you will do me the honour to sit down. Pass him a clean plate,
  General.&rdquo; And, as true as I&rsquo;m here, Boney slid a plate along just like a
  sulky child. He was a lanky-haired, yellow-skinned little man, as nervous as a
  cat&mdash;and as dangerous. I could feel that.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Talleyrand, crossing his game leg over his sound
  one, "will you tell me your story?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was in a fluster, but I told him nearly everything from the time he left me
  the five hundred dollars in Philadelphia, up to my losing ship and cargo at Le Havre.
  Boney began by listening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg
  208]</a></span> but after a bit he dropped into his own thoughts and looked at the
  crowd sideways through the front-room curtains. Talleyrand called to him when I&rsquo;d
  done.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Eh? What we need now,&rdquo; says Boney, &ldquo;is peace for the next
  three or four years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; says Talleyrand. &ldquo;Meantime I want the
  Consul&rsquo;s order to the Prize Court at Le Havre to restore my friend here his
  ship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; says Boney. &ldquo;Give away an oak-built brig of two
  hundred and seven tons for sentiment? Certainly not! She must be armed into my Navy
  with ten&mdash;no, fourteen twelve-pounders and two long fours. Is she strong enough to
  bear a long twelve forward?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now I could ha&rsquo; sworn he&rsquo;d paid no heed to my talk, but that
  wonderful head-piece of his seemingly skimmed off every word of it that was useful to
  him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, General!&rdquo; says Talleyrand. &ldquo;You are a magician&mdash;a
  magician without morals. But the brig is undoubtedly American, and we don&rsquo;t want
  to offend them more than we have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Need anybody talk about the affair?&rdquo; he says. He didn&rsquo;t
  look at me, but I knew what was in his mind&mdash;just cold murder because I worried
  him; and he&rsquo;d order it as easy as ordering his carriage.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;em,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  twenty-two other men besides me.&rdquo; I felt a little more &rsquo;ud set me screaming
  like a wired hare.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Undoubtedly American,&rdquo; Talleyrand goes on. &ldquo;You would gain
  something if you returned the ship&mdash;with a message of fraternal
  good-will&mdash;published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg
  209]</a></span> in the <i>Moniteur</i>&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s a French paper like the
  Philadelphia <i>Aurora</i>).</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A good idea!&rdquo; Boney answers. &ldquo;One could say much in a
  message.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It might be useful,&rdquo; says Talleyrand. &ldquo;Shall I have the
  message prepared?&rdquo; He wrote something in a little pocket ledger.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;for me to embellish this evening. The <i>Moniteur</i> will
  publish it to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly. Sign, please,&rdquo; says Talleyrand, tearing the leaf
  out.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the order to return the brig,&rdquo; says Boney.
  &ldquo;Is that necessary? Why should I lose a good ship? Haven&rsquo;t I lost enough
  ships already?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Talleyrand didn&rsquo;t answer any of those questions. Then Boney sidled up
  to the table and jabs his pen into the ink. Then he shies at the paper again: &ldquo;My
  signature alone is useless,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You must have the other two Consuls
  as well. Siey&egrave;s and Roger Ducos must sign. We must preserve the Laws.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;By the time my friend presents it,&rdquo; says Talleyrand, still
  looking out of the window, &ldquo;only one signature will be necessary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Boney smiles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a swindle,&rdquo; says he, but he signed and
  pushed the paper across.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Give that to the President of the Prize Court at Le Havre,&rdquo; says
  Talleyrand, &ldquo;and he will give you back your ship. I will settle for the cargo
  myself. You have told me how much it cost. What profit did you expect to make on
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, as man to man, I was bound to warn him that I&rsquo;d set out to
  run it into England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg
  210]</a></span> without troubling the Revenue, and so I couldn&rsquo;t rightly set
  bounds to my profits.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I guessed that all along,&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;There was never a Lee to Warminghurst&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i2">That wasn&rsquo;t a smuggler last and first.&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>The children laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s comical enough now,&rsquo; said Pharaoh. &lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t
  laugh then. Says Talleyrand after a minute, &ldquo;I am a bad accountant and I have
  several calculations on hand at present. Shall we say twice the cost of the
  cargo?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Say? I couldn&rsquo;t say a word. I sat choking and nodding like a China
  image while he wrote an order to his secretary to pay me, I won&rsquo;t say how much,
  because you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh! Bless you, abb&eacute;! God bless you!&rdquo; I got it out at
  last.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I am a priest in spite of myself, but they
  call me bishop now. Take this for my episcopal blessing,&rdquo; and he hands me the
  paper.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He stole all that money from me,&rdquo; says Boney over my shoulder.
  &ldquo;A Bank of France is another of the things we must make. Are you mad?&rdquo; he
  shouts at Talleyrand.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; says Talleyrand, getting up. &ldquo;But be calm; the
  disease will never attack you. It is called gratitude. This gentleman found me in the
  street and fed me when I was hungry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I see; and he has made a fine scene of it and you have paid him, I
  suppose. Meantime, France waits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh! poor France!&rdquo; says Talleyrand. &ldquo;Good-bye,<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> Candide,&rdquo; he says
  to me. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;have you yet got Red Jacket&rsquo;s
  permission to tell me what the President said to his Cabinet after Monsieur Gen&ecirc;t
  rode away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t speak, I could only shake my head, and Boney&mdash;so
  impatient he was to go on with his doings&mdash;he ran at me and fair pushed me out of
  the room. And that was all there was to it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Pharaoh stood up and slid his fiddle into one of his big skirt pockets as though it
  were a dead hare.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh! but we want to know lots and lots more,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;How you
  got home&mdash;and what old Maingon said on the barge&mdash;and wasn&rsquo;t your
  cousin surprised when he had to give back the <i>Berthe Aurette</i>,
  and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Tell us more about Toby!&rsquo; cried Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and Red Jacket,&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell us any more?&rsquo; they both pleaded.</p>

  <p>Puck kicked the oak branch on the fire, till it sent up a column of smoke that made
  them sneeze. When they had finished the Shaw was empty except for old Hobden stamping
  through the larches.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They gipsies have took two,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;my black pullet and my
  liddle gingy-speckled cockrel.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; said Dan, picking up one tail-feather the old woman had
  overlooked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Which way did they go? Which way did the runagates go?&rsquo; said
  Hobden.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hobby!&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Would you like it if we told Keeper Ridley all
  your goings and comings?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id=

  Conversion of St. Wilfrid</h2>

  <p>They had bought peppermints up at the village, and were coming home past little St.
  Barnabas&rsquo;s church, when they saw Jimmy Kidbrooke, the carpenter&rsquo;s baby,
  kicking at the churchyard gate, with a shaving in his mouth and the tears running down
  his cheeks.</p>

  <p>Una pulled out the shaving and put in a peppermint. Jimmy said he was looking for
  his grand-daddy&mdash;he never seemed to take much notice of his father&mdash;so they
  went up between the old graves, under the leaf-dropping limes, to the porch, where Jim
  trotted in, looked about the empty church, and screamed like a gate-hinge.</p>

  <p>Young Sam Kidbrooke&rsquo;s voice came from the bell-tower, and made them jump.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why, Jimmy,&rsquo; he called, &lsquo;what are you doin&rsquo; here? Fetch
  him, Father!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Old Mr. Kidbrooke stumped downstairs, jerked Jimmy on to his shoulder, stared at the
  children beneath his brass spectacles, and stumped back again. They laughed: it was so
  exactly like Mr. Kidbrooke.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; Una called up the stairs.<span class=

  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s come off by himself. She&rsquo;ll be just about crazy,&rsquo; Sam
  answered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll run down street and tell her.&rsquo; Una darted off.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Thank you, Miss Una. Would you like to see how we&rsquo;re mendin&rsquo; the
  bell-beams, Mus&rsquo; Dan?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Dan hopped up, and saw young Sam lying on his stomach in a most delightful place
  among beams and ropes, close to the five great bells. Old Mr. Kidbrooke on the floor
  beneath was planing a piece of wood, and Jimmy was eating the shavings as fast as they
  came away. He never looked at Jimmy; Jimmy never stopped eating; and the broad
  gilt-bobbed pendulum of the church clock never stopped swinging across the white-washed
  wall of the tower.</p>

  <p>Dan winked through the sawdust that fell on his up-turned face. &lsquo;Ring a
  bell,&rsquo; he called.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t do that, but I&rsquo;ll buzz one of &rsquo;em a bit for
  you,&rsquo; said Sam. He pounded on the sound-bow of the biggest bell, and waked a
  hollow groaning boom that ran up and down the tower like creepy feelings down your
  back. Just when it almost began to hurt, it died away in a hurry of beautiful sorrowful
  cries, like a wineglass rubbed with a wet finger. The pendulum clanked&mdash;one loud
  clank to each silent swing.</p>

  <p>Dan heard Una return from Mrs. Kidbrooke&rsquo;s, and ran down to fetch her. She was
  standing by the font staring at some one who kneeled at the altar rail.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Is that the lady who practises the organ?&rsquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No. She&rsquo;s gone into the organ-place. Besides, she wears black,&rsquo;
  Dan replied.</p>

  <p>The figure rose and came down the nave. It was a white-haired man in a long white
  gown with a sort of scarf looped low on the neck, one end hanging over his shoulder.
  His loose long sleeves were embroidered with gold, and a deep strip of gold embroidery
  waved and sparkled round the hem of his gown.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Go and meet him,&rsquo; said Puck&rsquo;s voice behind the font.
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only Wilfrid.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wilfrid who?&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;You come along too.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wilfrid&mdash;Saint of Sussex, and Archbishop of York. <i>I</i> shall wait
  till he asks me.&rsquo; He waved them forward. Their feet squeaked on the old grave
  slabs in the centre aisle. The Archbishop raised one hand with a pink ring on it, and
  said something in Latin. He was very handsome, and his thin face looked almost as
  silvery as his thin circle of hair.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Are you alone?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Puck&rsquo;s here, of course,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Do you know
  him?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I know him better now than I used to.&rsquo; He beckoned over Dan&rsquo;s
  shoulder, and spoke again in Latin. Puck pattered forward, holding himself as straight
  as an arrow. The Archbishop smiled.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Be welcome,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Be very welcome.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Welcome to you also, O Prince of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224"
  id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> Church,&rsquo; Puck replied. The Archbishop bowed his
  head and passed on, till he glimmered like a white moth in the shadow by the font.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He does look awfully princely,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he coming
  back?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh yes. He&rsquo;s only looking over the church. He&rsquo;s very fond of
  churches,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The Lady who practises the organ was speaking to the blower-boy behind the
  organ-screen. &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t very well talk here,&rsquo; Puck whispered.
  &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Panama Corner.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He led them to the end of the south aisle, where there is a slab of iron which says
  in queer, long-tailed letters: <i>Orate p. annema Jhone Coline</i>. The children always
  called it Panama Corner.</p>

  <p>The Archbishop moved slowly about the little church, peering at the old memorial
  tablets and the new glass windows. The Lady who practises the organ began to pull out
  stops and rustle hymnbooks behind the screen.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll do all the soft lacey tunes&mdash;like treacle on
  porridge,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I like the trumpety ones best,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;Oh, look at Wilfrid!
  He&rsquo;s trying to shut the altar gates!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Tell him he mustn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Puck, quite seriously.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He can&rsquo;t, anyhow,&rsquo; Dan muttered, and tiptoed out of Panama Corner
  while the Archbishop patted and patted at the carved gates that always sprang open
  again beneath his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg
  225]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s no use, sir,&rsquo; Dan whispered. &lsquo;Old Mr. Kidbrooke says
  altar-gates are just <i>the</i> one pair of gates which no man can shut. He made
  &rsquo;em so himself.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The Archbishop&rsquo;s blue eyes twinkled. Dan saw that he knew all about it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; Dan stammered&mdash;very angry with Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, I know! He made them so Himself.&rsquo; The Archbishop smiled, and
  crossed to Panama Corner, where Una dragged up a certain padded arm-chair for him to
  sit on.</p>

  <p>The organ played softly. &lsquo;What does that music say?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Una dropped into the chant without thinking: &lsquo;"Oh, all ye works of the Lord,
  bless ye the Lord; praise him and magnify him for ever.&rdquo; We call it the
  Noah&rsquo;s Ark, because it&rsquo;s all lists of things&mdash;beasts and birds and
  whales, you know.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Whales?&rsquo; said the Archbishop quickly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;"O ye whales, and all that move in the waters,"&rsquo; Una
  hummed&mdash;&rsquo;&ldquo;Bless ye the Lord&rdquo;&mdash;it sounds like a wave turning
  over, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Holy Father,&rsquo; said Puck with a demure face, &lsquo;is a little seal
  also &ldquo;one who moves in the water&ldquo;?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Eh? Oh yes&mdash;yess!&rsquo; he laughed. &lsquo;A seal moves wonderfully in
  the waters. Do the seal come to my island still?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Puck shook his head. &lsquo;All those little islands have been swept
  away.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
  226]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Very possible. The tides ran fiercely down there. Do you know the land of the
  Sea-calf, maiden?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No&mdash;but we&rsquo;ve seen seals&mdash;at Brighton.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Archbishop is thinking of a little farther down the coast. He means
  Seal&rsquo;s Eye&mdash;Selsea&mdash;down Chichester way&mdash;where he converted the
  South Saxons,&rsquo; Puck explained.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;yess; if the South Saxons did not convert me,&rsquo; said the
  Archbishop, smiling. &lsquo;The first time I was wrecked was on that coast. As our ship
  took ground and we tried to push her off, an old fat fellow, I remember, reared breast
  high out of the water, and scratched his head with his flipper as if he were saying:
  &ldquo;What <i>does</i> that respectable person with the pole think he is doing?&rdquo;
  I was very wet and miserable, but I could not help laughing, till the natives came down
  and attacked us.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What did you do?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;One couldn&rsquo;t very well go back to France, so one tried to make them go
  back to the shore. All the South Saxons are born wreckers, like my own Northumbrian
  folk. I was bringing over a few things for my old church at York, and some of the
  natives laid hands on them, and&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid I lost my temper.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It is said,&rsquo; Puck&rsquo;s voice was wickedly meek, &lsquo;that there
  was a great fight.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Eh, but I must ha&rsquo; been a silly lad.&rsquo; Wilfrid spoke with a sudden
  thick burr in his voice. He coughed, and took up his silvery tones again. &lsquo;There
  was no fight really. My men thumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id=
  "Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> a few of them, but the tide rose half an hour before its
  time, with a strong wind, and we backed off. What I wanted to say, though, was, that
  the seas about us were full of sleek seals watching the scuffle. My good Eddi&mdash;my
  chaplain&mdash;insisted that they were demons. Yes&mdash;yess! That was my first
  acquaintance with the South Saxons and their seals.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But not the only time you were wrecked, was it?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Alas, no! On sea and land my life seems to have been one long
  shipwreck,&rsquo; He looked at the Jhone Coline slab as old Hobden sometimes looks into
  the fire. &lsquo;Ah, well!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But did you ever have any more adventures among the seals?&rsquo; said Una,
  after a pause.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, the seals! I beg your pardon. They are the important things.
  Yes&mdash;yess! I went back to the South Saxons after twelve&mdash;fifteen years. No, I
  did not come by water, but overland from my own Northumbria, to see what I could do.
  It&rsquo;s little one <i>can</i> do with that class of native except make them stop
  killing each other and themselves&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why did they kill themselves?&rsquo; Una asked, her chin in her hand.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Because they were heathen. When they grew tired of life (as if they were the
  only people) they would jump into the sea. They called it going to Wotan. It
  wasn&rsquo;t want of food always&mdash;by any means. A man would tell you that he felt
  grey in the heart, or a woman would say that she saw nothing but long days
  in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> front of
  her; and they&rsquo;d saunter away to the mud-flats and&mdash;that would be the end of
  them, poor souls, unless one headed them off! One had to run quick, but one can&rsquo;t
  allow people to lay hands on themselves because they happen to feel grey.
  Yes&mdash;yess! Extraordinary people, the South Saxons. Disheartening, sometimes....
  What does that say now?&rsquo; The organ had changed tune again.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Only a hymn for next Sunday,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;"The Church&rsquo;s One
  Foundation." Go on, please, about running over the mud. I should like to have seen
  you.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I dare say you would, and I really <i>could</i> run in those days. Ethelwalch
  the king gave me some five or six muddy parishes by the sea, and the first time my good
  Eddi and I rode there we saw a man slouching along the slob, among the seals at Manhood
  End. My good Eddi disliked seals&mdash;but he swallowed his objections and ran like a
  hare.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;For the same reason that I did. We thought it was one of our people going to
  drown himself. As a matter of fact, Eddi and I were nearly drowned in the pools before
  we overtook him. To cut a long story short, we found ourselves very muddy, very
  breathless, being quietly made fun of in good Latin by a very well-spoken person.
  No&mdash;he&rsquo;d no idea of going to Wotan. He was fishing on his own beaches, and
  he showed us the beacons and turf-heaps that divided his lands from the Church
  property. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg
  229]</a></span> us to his own house, gave us a good dinner, some more than good wine,
  sent a guide with us into Chichester, and became one of my best and most refreshing
  friends. He was a Meon by descent, from the west edge of the kingdom; a scholar
  educated, curiously enough, at Lyons, my old school; had travelled the world over, even
  to Rome, and was a brilliant talker. We found we had scores of acquaintances in common.
  It seemed he was a small chief under King Ethelwalch, and I fancy the King was somewhat
  afraid of him. The South Saxons mistrust a man who talks too well. Ah! <i>Now</i>,
  I&rsquo;ve left out the very point of my story. He kept a great grey-muzzled old
  dog-seal that he had brought up from a pup. He called it Padda&mdash;after one of my
  clergy. It <i>was</i> rather like fat, honest old Padda. The creature followed him
  everywhere, and nearly knocked down my good Eddi when we first met him. Eddi loathed
  it. It used to sniff at his thin legs and cough at him. I can&rsquo;t say I ever took
  much notice of it (I was not fond of animals), till one day Eddi came to me with a
  circumstantial account of some witchcraft that Meon worked. He would tell the seal to
  go down to the beach the last thing at night, and bring him word of the weather. When
  it came back, Meon might say to his slaves, &ldquo;Padda thinks we shall have wind
  to-morrow. Haul up the boats!" I spoke to Meon casually about the story, and he
  laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He told me he could judge by the look of the creature&rsquo;s coat and the
  way it sniffed what weather was brewing. Quite possible. One need<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> not put down everything
  one does not understand to the work of bad spirits&mdash;or good ones, for that
  matter.&rsquo; He nodded towards Puck, who nodded gaily in return.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I say so,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;because to a certain extent I have been
  made a victim of that habit of mind. Some while after I was settled at Selsea, King
  Ethelwalch and Queen Ebba ordered their people to be baptized. I fear I&rsquo;m too old
  to believe that a whole nation can change its heart at the King&rsquo;s command, and I
  had a shrewd suspicion that their real motive was to get a good harvest. No rain had
  fallen for two or three years, but as soon as we had finished baptizing, it fell
  heavily, and they all said it was a miracle.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And was it?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Everything in life is a miracle, but&rsquo;&mdash;the Archbishop twisted the
  heavy ring on his finger&mdash;&lsquo;I should be slow&mdash;ve-ry slow should I
  be&mdash;to assume that a certain sort of miracle happens whenever lazy and improvident
  people say they are going to turn over a new leaf if they are paid for it. My friend
  Meon had sent his slaves to the font, but he had not come himself, so the next time I
  rode over&mdash;to return a manuscript&mdash;I took the liberty of asking why. He was
  perfectly open about it. He looked on the King&rsquo;s action as a heathen attempt to
  curry favour with the Christians&rsquo; God through me the Archbishop, and he would
  have none of it. "My dear man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;admitting that that is the case,
  surely you, as an educated person, don&rsquo;t believe in Wotan and all the other
  hobgoblins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
  any more than Padda here.&rdquo; The old seal was hunched up on his ox-hide behind his
  master&rsquo;s chair.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Even if I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why should I insult the
  memory of my fathers&rsquo; Gods? I have sent you a hundred and three of my rascals to
  christen. Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I want <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He wants us! What do you think of that, Padda?&rdquo; He pulled the
  seal&rsquo;s whiskers till it threw back its head and roared, and he pretended to
  interpret. &ldquo;No! Padda says he won&rsquo;t be baptized yet awhile. He says
  you&rsquo;ll stay to dinner and come fishing with me to-morrow, because you&rsquo;re
  overworked and need a rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d keep yon brute in its proper place,&rdquo; I said,
  and Eddi, my chaplain, agreed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Meon. &ldquo;I keep him just next my heart. He
  can&rsquo;t tell a lie, and he doesn&rsquo;t know how to love any one except me. It
  &rsquo;ud be the same if I were dying on a mud-bank, wouldn&rsquo;t it,
  Padda?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Augh! Augh!&rdquo; said Padda, and put up his head to be
  scratched.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then Meon began to tease Eddi: &ldquo;Padda says, if Eddi saw his Archbishop
  dying on a mud*-bank Eddi would tuck up his gown and run. Padda knows Eddi can run too!
  Padda came into Wittering Church last Sunday&mdash;all wet&mdash;to hear the music, and
  Eddi ran out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;My good Eddi rubbed his hands and his shins together, and flushed. "Padda is
  a child of the Devil, who is the father of lies!&rdquo; he cried,<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> and begged my pardon for
  having spoken. I forgave him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes. You are just about stupid enough for a musician,&rdquo; said
  Meon. &ldquo;But here he is. Sing a hymn to him, and see if he can stand it.
  You&rsquo;ll find my small harp beside the fireplace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Eddi, who is really an excellent musician, played and sang for quite half an
  hour. Padda shuffled off his ox-hide, hunched himself on his flippers before him, and
  listened with his head thrown back. Yes&mdash;yess! A rather funny sight! Meon tried
  not to laugh, and asked Eddi if he were satisfied.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It takes some time to get an idea out of my good Eddi&rsquo;s head. He looked
  at me.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Do you want to sprinkle him with holy water, and see if he flies up
  the chimney? Why not baptize him?&rdquo; said Meon.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Eddi was really shocked. I thought it was bad taste myself.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; said Meon. &ldquo;You call him a demon
  and a familiar spirit because he loves his master and likes music, and when I offer you
  a chance to prove it you won&rsquo;t take it. Look here! I&rsquo;ll make a bargain.
  I&rsquo;ll be baptized if you&rsquo;ll baptize Padda too. He&rsquo;s more of a man than
  most of my slaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t bargain&mdash;or joke&mdash;about these
  matters,&rdquo; I said. He was going altogether too far.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Meon; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like any one
  to joke about Padda. Padda, go down to the beach and bring us to-morrow&rsquo;s
  weather!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;My good Eddi must have been a little over-tired<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> with his day&rsquo;s work. "I am a servant
  of the Church,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My business is to save souls, not to enter into
  fellowships and understandings with accursed beasts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Have it your own narrow way,&rdquo; said Meon. &ldquo;Padda, you
  needn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo; The old fellow flounced back to his ox-hide at once.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Man could learn obedience at least from that creature,&rdquo; said
  Eddi, a little ashamed of himself. Christians should not curse.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin to apologise just when I am beginning to like
  you,&rdquo; said Meon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave Padda behind to-morrow&mdash;out of
  respect to your feelings. Now let&rsquo;s go to supper. We must be up early to-morrow
  for the whiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The next was a beautiful crisp autumn morning&mdash;a weather breeder, if I
  had taken the trouble to think; but it&rsquo;s refreshing to escape from kings and
  converts for half a day. We three went by ourselves in Meon&rsquo;s smallest boat, and
  we got on the whiting near an old wreck, a mile or so off shore. Meon knew the marks to
  a yard, and the fish were keen. Yes&mdash;yess! A perfect morning&rsquo;s fishing! If a
  bishop can&rsquo;t be a fisherman, who can?&rsquo; He twiddled his ring again.
  &lsquo;We stayed there a little too long, and while we were getting up our stone, down
  came the fog. After some discussion, we decided to row for the land. The ebb was just
  beginning to make round the point, and sent us all ways at once like a
  coracle.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Selsea Bill,&rsquo; said Puck under his breath. &lsquo;The tides run
  something furious there.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id=
  "Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I believe you,&rsquo; said the Archbishop. &lsquo;Meon and I have spent a
  good many evenings arguing as to where exactly we drifted. All I know is we found
  ourselves in a little rocky cove that had sprung up round us out of the fog, and a
  swell lifted the boat on to a ledge, and she broke up beneath our feet. We had just
  time to shuffle through the weed before the next wave. The sea was rising.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a pity we didn&rsquo;t let Padda go down to the
  beach last night,&rdquo; said Meon. &ldquo;He might have warned us this was
  coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Better fall into the hands of God than the hands of demons,&rdquo;
  said Eddi, and his teeth chattered as he prayed. A nor&rsquo;-west breeze had just got
  up&mdash;distinctly cool.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Save what you can of the boat,&rdquo; said Meon; &ldquo;we may need
  it,&rdquo; and we had to drench ourselves again, fishing out stray planks.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What for?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;For firewood. We did not know when we should get off. Eddi had flint and
  steel, and we found dry fuel in the old gulls&rsquo; nests and lit a fire. It smoked
  abominably, and we guarded it with boat-planks up-ended between the rocks. One gets
  used to that sort of thing if one travels. Unluckily I&rsquo;m not so strong as I was.
  I fear I must have been a trouble to my friends. It was blowing a full gale before
  midnight. Eddi wrung out his cloak, and tried to wrap me in it, but I ordered him on
  his obedience to keep it. However, he held me in his arms all the first night, and Meon
  begged his pardon for what he&rsquo;d said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id=
  "Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> the night before&mdash;about Eddi running away if he
  found me on a sandbank, you remember.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are right in half your prophecy,&rdquo; said Eddi. &ldquo;I have
  tucked up my gown, at any rate.&rdquo; (The wind had blown it over his head.)
  &ldquo;Now let us thank God for His mercies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Meon. &ldquo;If this gale lasts, we stand a very fair
  chance of dying of starvation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If it be God&rsquo;s will that we live, God will provide,&rdquo; said
  Eddi. &ldquo;At least help me to sing to Him.&rdquo; The wind almost whipped the words
  out of his mouth, but he braced himself against a rock and sang psalms.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad I never concealed my opinion&mdash;from myself&mdash;that Eddi
  was a better man than I. Yet I have worked hard in my time&mdash;very hard!
  Yes&mdash;yess! So the morning and the evening were our second day on that islet. There
  was rainwater in the rock pools, and, as a Churchman, I knew how to fast, but I admit
  we were hungry. Meon fed our fire chip by chip to eke it out, and they made me sit over
  it, the dear fellows, when I was too weak to object. Meon held me in his arms the
  second night, just like a child. My good Eddi was a little out of his senses, and
  imagined himself teaching a York choir to sing. Even so, he was beautifully patient
  with them.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I heard Meon whisper, &ldquo;If this keeps up we shall go to our Gods. I
  wonder what Wotan will say to me. He must know I don&rsquo;t believe in him. On the
  other hand, I can&rsquo;t do what Ethelwalch finds so easy&mdash;curry favour with your
  God at the last minute, in the hope of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236"
  id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> saved&mdash;as you call it. How do you advise,
  Bishop?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if that is your honest belief, I
  take it upon myself to say you had far better not curry favour with any God. But if
  it&rsquo;s only your Jutish pride that holds you back, lift me up, and I&rsquo;ll
  baptize you even now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Lie still,&rdquo; said Meon. &ldquo;I could judge better if I were in
  my own hall. But to desert one&rsquo;s fathers&rsquo; Gods&mdash;even if one
  doesn&rsquo;t believe in them&mdash;in the middle of a gale, isn&rsquo;t
  quite&mdash;What would you do yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was lying in his arms, kept alive by the warmth of his big, steady heart.
  It did not seem to me the time or the place for subtle arguments, so I answered,
  &ldquo;No, I certainly should not desert my God.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t see even now what
  else I could have said.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll remember that, if I live,&rdquo; said Meon, and
  I must have drifted back to my dreams about Northumbria and beautiful France, for it
  was broad daylight when I heard him calling on Wotan in that high, shaking heathen yell
  that I detest so.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Lie quiet. I&rsquo;m giving Wotan his chance,&rdquo; he said. Our dear
  Eddi ambled up, still beating time to his imaginary choir.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes. Call on your Gods,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and see what gifts
  they will send you. They are gone on a journey, or they are hunting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I assure you the words were not out of his mouth when old Padda shot from the
  top of a cold wrinkled swell, drove himself over the weedy<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> ledge, and landed fair
  in our laps with a rock-cod between his teeth. I could not help smiling at Eddi&rsquo;s
  face. &ldquo;A miracle! A miracle!&rdquo; he cried, and kneeled down to clean the
  cod.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a long time winding us, my son,&rdquo; said Meon.
  &ldquo;Now fish&mdash;fish for all our lives. We&rsquo;re starving, Padda.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The old fellow flung himself quivering like a salmon backward into the boil
  of the currents round the rocks, and Meon said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe. I&rsquo;ll
  send him to fetch help when this wind drops. Eat and be thankful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I never tasted anything so good as those rock-codlings we took from
  Padda&rsquo;s mouth and half roasted over the fire. Between his plunges Padda would
  hunch up and purr over Meon with the tears running down his face. I never knew before
  that seals could weep for joy&mdash;as I have wept.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Eddi, with his mouth full, &ldquo;God has made the
  seal the loveliest of His creatures in the water. Look how Padda breasts the current!
  He stands up against it like a rock; now watch the chain of bubbles where he dives; and
  now&mdash;there is his wise head under that rock ledge! Oh, a blessing be on thee, my
  little brother Padda!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You <i>said</i> he was a child of the Devil!&rdquo; Meon laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There I sinned,&rdquo; poor Eddi answered. &ldquo;Call him here, and I
  will ask his pardon. God sent him out of the storm to humble me, a fool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you to enter into fellowships<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> and understandings with
  any accursed brute,&rdquo; said Meon, rather unkindly. &ldquo;Shall we say he was sent
  to our Bishop as the ravens were sent to your prophet Elijah?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Doubtless that is so,&rdquo; said Eddi. &ldquo;I will write it so if I
  live to get home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let us three poor men kneel and
  thank God for His mercies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We kneeled, and old Padda shuffled up and thrust his head under Meon&rsquo;s
  elbows. I laid my hand upon it and blessed him. So did Eddi.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And now, my son,&rdquo; I said to Meon, &ldquo;shall I baptize
  thee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Wait till we are well ashore and at
  home. No God in any Heaven shall say that I came to him or left him because I was wet
  and cold. I will send Padda to my people for a boat. Is that witchcraft,
  Eddi?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, no. Surely Padda will go and pull them to the beach by the skirts
  of their gowns as he pulled me in Wittering Church to ask me to sing. Only then I was
  afraid, and did not understand,&rdquo; said Eddi.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are understanding now,&rdquo; said Meon, and at a wave of his arm
  off went Padda to the mainland, making a wake like a war-boat till we lost him in the
  rain. Meon&rsquo;s people could not bring a boat across for some hours; even so it was
  ticklish work among the rocks in that tideway. But they hoisted me aboard, too stiff to
  move, and Padda swam behind us, barking and turning somersaults all the way to Manhood
  End!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Good old Padda!&rsquo; murmured Dan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
  id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;When we were quite rested and re-clothed, and his people had been
  summoned&mdash;not an hour before&mdash;Meon offered himself to be baptized.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Was Padda baptized too?&rsquo; Una asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, that was only Meon&rsquo;s joke. But he sat blinking on his ox-hide in
  the middle of the hall. When Eddi (who thought I wasn&rsquo;t looking) made a little
  cross in holy water on his wet muzzle, he kissed Eddi&rsquo;s hand. A week before Eddi
  wouldn&rsquo;t have touched him. <i>That</i> was a miracle, if you like! But seriously,
  I was more glad than I can tell you to get Meon. A rare and splendid soul that never
  looked back&mdash;never looked back!&rsquo; The Archbishop half closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But, sir,&rsquo; said Puck, most respectfully, &lsquo;haven&rsquo;t you left
  out what Meon said afterwards?&rsquo; Before the Bishop could speak he turned to the
  children and went on: &lsquo;Meon called all his fishers and ploughmen and herdsmen
  into the hall and he said: &ldquo;Listen, men! Two days ago I asked our Bishop whether
  it was fair for a man to desert his fathers&rsquo; Gods in a time of danger. Our Bishop
  said it was not fair. You needn&rsquo;t shout like that, because you are all Christians
  now. My red war-boat&rsquo;s crew will remember how near we all were to death when
  Padda fetched them over to the Bishop&rsquo;s islet. You can tell your mates that even
  in that place, at that time, hanging on the wet, weedy edge of death, our Bishop, a
  Christian, counselled me, a heathen, to stand by my fathers&rsquo; Gods. I tell you now
  that a faith which takes care that every man shall keep faith, even though he may save
  his soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> by
  breaking faith, is the faith for a man to believe in. So I believe in the Christian
  God, and in Wilfrid His Archbishop, and in the Church that Wilfrid rules. You have been
  baptized once by the King&rsquo;s orders. I shall not have you baptized again; but if I
  find any more old women being sent to Wotan, or any girls dancing on the sly before
  Balder, or any men talking about Thun or Lok or the rest, I will teach you with my own
  hands how to keep faith with the Christian God. Go out quietly; you&rsquo;ll find a
  couple of beefs on the beach.&rdquo; Then of course they shouted &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
  which meant &ldquo;Thor help us!&rdquo; and&mdash;I think you laughed, sir?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I think you remember it all too well,&rsquo; said the Archbishop, smiling.
  &lsquo;It was a joyful day for me. I had learned a great deal on that rock where Padda
  found us. Yes&mdash;yess! One should deal kindly with all the creatures of God, and
  gently with their masters. But one learns late.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He rose, and his gold-embroidered sleeves rustled thickly.</p>

  <p>The organ clacked and took deep breaths.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; Dan whispered. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s going to do the
  trumpety one. It takes all the wind you can pump. It&rsquo;s in Latin, sir.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There is no other tongue,&rsquo; the Archbishop answered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a real hymn,&rsquo; Una explained. &lsquo;She does it as a
  treat after her exercises. She isn&rsquo;t a real organist, you know. She just comes
  down here sometimes, from the Albert Hall.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, what a miracle of a voice!&rsquo; said the Archbishop.</p>

  <p>It rang out suddenly from a dark arch of lonely noises&mdash;every word spoken to
  the very end.</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;Dies Irae, dies illa</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Solvet <ins class="correction" title="original: soeclum">saeclum</ins>
  in favilla</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Teste David cum Sibylla.&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>The Archbishop caught his breath and moved forward.</p>

  <p>The music carried on by itself a while.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s calling all the light out of the windows,&rsquo; Una whispered
  to Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s more like a horse neighing in battle,&rsquo; he whispered
  back. The voice cried:</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;Tuba mirum spargens sonum</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Per sepulchra regionum.&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>Deeper and deeper the organ dived down, but far below its deepest note they heard
  Puck&rsquo;s voice joining in the last line:</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;Coget omnes ante thronum.&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>As they looked in wonder, for it sounded like the dull jar of one of the very
  pillars shifting, the little fellow turned and went out through the south door.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now&rsquo;s the sorrowful part, but it&rsquo;s very beautiful.&rsquo; Una
  found herself speaking to the empty chair in front of her.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What are you doing that for?&rsquo; Dan said behind her. &lsquo;You spoke so
  politely too.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know ... I thought ...&rsquo; said Una.
  &lsquo;Funny!&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg
  242]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s the part you like best,&rsquo; Dan
  grunted.</p>

  <p>The music had turned soft&mdash;full of little sounds that chased each other on
  wings across the broad gentle flood of the main tune. But the voice was ten times
  lovelier than the music.</p>

  <p><span class="i2">&lsquo;Recordare Jesu pie,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Quod sum causa Tuae viae,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Ne me perdas ill&acirc; die!&rsquo;</span><br /></p>

  <p>There was no more. They moved out into the centre-aisle.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;That you?&rsquo; the Lady called as she shut the lid. &lsquo;I thought
  I heard you, and I played it on purpose.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Thank you awfully,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;We hoped you would, so we waited.
  Come on, Una, it&rsquo;s pretty nearly dinner-time.&rsquo;</p>

  Doctor of Medicine</h2>

  <p>They were playing hide-and-seek with bicycle lamps after tea. Dan had hung his lamp
  on the apple tree at the end of the hellebore bed in the walled garden, and was
  crouched by the gooseberry bushes ready to dash off when Una should spy him. He saw her
  lamp come into the garden and disappear as she hid it under her cloak. While he
  listened for her footsteps, somebody (they both thought it was Phillips the gardener)
  coughed in the corner of the herb-beds.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; Una shouted across the asparagus; &lsquo;we aren&rsquo;t
  hurting your old beds, Phippsey!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She flashed her lantern towards the spot, and in its circle of light they saw a Guy
  Fawkes-looking man in a black cloak and a steeple-crowned hat, walking down the path
  beside Puck. They ran to meet him, and the man said something to them about
  <i>rooms</i> in their head. After a time they understood he was warning them not to
  catch colds.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve a bit of a cold yourself, haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Una,
  for he ended all his sentences with a consequential cough. Puck laughed.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Child,&rsquo; the man answered, &lsquo;if it hath pleased Heaven to afflict
  me with an infirmity&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo; Puck struck in, &lsquo;the maid spoke out of kindness.
  <i>I</i> know that half your cough is but a catch to trick the vulgar; and that&rsquo;s
  a pity. There&rsquo;s honesty enough in you, Nick, without rasping and
  hawking.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Good people&rsquo;&mdash;the man shrugged his lean shoulders&mdash;&rsquo;the
  vulgar crowd love not truth unadorned. Wherefore we philosophers must needs dress her
  to catch their eye or&mdash;ahem!&mdash;their ear.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And what d&rsquo;you think of <i>that</i>?&rsquo; said Puck solemnly to
  Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;It sounds like
  lessons.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;well! There have been worse men than Nick Culpeper to take lessons
  from. Now, where can we sit that&rsquo;s not indoors?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;In the hay-mow, next to old Middenboro,&rsquo; Dan suggested.
  &lsquo;<i>He</i> doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; Mr. Culpeper was stooping over the pale hellebore blooms by the
  light of Una&rsquo;s lamp. &lsquo;Does Master Middenboro need my poor services,
  then?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Save him, no!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;He is but a horse&mdash;next door to
  an ass, as you&rsquo;ll see presently. Come!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Their shadows jumped and slid on the fruit-tree walls. They filed out of the garden
  by the snoring pig-pound and the crooning hen-house, to the shed where Middenboro the
  old lawn-mower pony lives. His friendly eyes showed green in the light as they set
  their lamps down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg
  255]</a></span> on the chickens&rsquo; drinking-trough outside, and pushed past to the
  hay-mow. Mr. Culpeper stooped at the door.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mind where you lie,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;This hay&rsquo;s full of
  hedge-brishings.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;In! in!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve lain in fouler places than
  this, Nick. Ah! Let us keep touch with the stars!&rsquo; He kicked open the top of the
  half door, and pointed to the clear sky. &lsquo;There be the planets you conjure with!
  What does your wisdom make of that wandering and variable star behind those apple
  boughs?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The children smiled. A bicycle that they knew well was being walked down the steep
  lane.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; Mr. Culpeper leaned forward quickly. &lsquo;That? Some
  countryman&rsquo;s lantern.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Wrong, Nick,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a singular bright star in
  Virgo, declining towards the house of Aquarius the water-carrier, who hath lately been
  afflicted by Gemini. Aren&rsquo;t I right, Una?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Culpeper snorted contemptuously.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No. It&rsquo;s the village nurse going down to the Mill about some fresh
  twins that came there last week. Nurse,&rsquo; Una called, as the light stopped on the
  flat, &lsquo;when can I see the Morris twins? And how are they?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Next Sunday, perhaps. Doing beautifully,&rsquo; the Nurse called back, and
  with a <i>ping-ping-ping</i> of the bell brushed round the corner.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Her Uncle&rsquo;s a vetinary surgeon near Banbury,&rsquo; Una explained,
  &lsquo;and if you ring her bell at night, it rings right beside her bed&mdash;not
  downstairs at all. Then she jumps up&mdash;she always keeps a pair<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> of dry boots in the
  fender, you know&mdash;and goes anywhere she&rsquo;s wanted. We help her bicycle
  through gaps sometimes. Most of her babies do beautifully. She told us so
  herself.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I doubt not, then, that she reads in my books,&rsquo; said Mr. Culpeper
  quietly. &lsquo;Twins at the Mill!&rsquo; he muttered half aloud. &lsquo;"And again He
  sayeth, Return, ye children of men."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Are you a doctor or a rector?&rsquo; Una asked, and Puck with a shout turned
  head over heels in the hay. But Mr. Culpeper was quite serious. He told them that he
  was a physician-astrologer&mdash;a doctor who knew all about the stars as well as all
  about herbs for medicine. He said that the sun, the moon, and five Planets, called
  Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, and Venus, governed everybody and everything in the
  world. They all lived in Houses&mdash;he mapped out some of them against the dark with
  a busy forefinger&mdash;and they moved from House to House like pieces at draughts; and
  they went loving and hating each other all over the skies. If you knew their likes and
  dislikes, he said, you could make them cure your patient and hurt your enemy, and find
  out the secret causes of things. He talked of these five Planets as though they
  belonged to him, or as though he were playing long games against them. The children
  burrowed in the hay up to their chins, and looked out over the half door at the solemn,
  star-powdered sky till they seemed to be falling upside down into it, while Mr.
  Culpeper talked about &lsquo;trines&rsquo; and &lsquo;oppositions&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;conjunctions&rsquo; and &lsquo;sympathies&rsquo; and &lsquo;antipathies&rsquo;
  in a tone that just matched things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id=
  "Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

  <p>A rat ran between Middenboro&rsquo;s feet, and the old pony stamped.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mid hates rats,&rsquo; said Dan, and passed him over a lock of hay. &lsquo;I
  wonder why.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Divine Astrology tells us,&rsquo; said Mr. Culpeper. &lsquo;The horse, being
  a martial beast that beareth man to battle, belongs naturally to the red planet
  Mars&mdash;the Lord of War. I would show you him, but he&rsquo;s too near his setting.
  Rats and mice, doing their businesses by night, come under the dominion of our Lady the
  Moon. Now between Mars and Luna, the one red, t&rsquo;other white, the one hot,
  t&rsquo;other cold and so forth, stands, as I have told you, a natural antipathy, or,
  as you say, hatred. Which antipathy their creatures do inherit. Whence, good people,
  you may both see and hear your cattle stamp in their stalls for the self-same causes as
  decree the passages of the stars across the unalterable face of Heaven!
  Ahem!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Puck lay along chewing a leaf. They felt him shake with laughter, and Mr. Culpeper
  sat up stiffly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I myself,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;have saved men&rsquo;s lives, and not a few
  neither, by observing at the proper time&mdash;there is a time, mark you, for all
  things under the sun&mdash;by observing, I say, so small a beast as a rat in
  conjunction with so great a matter as this dread arch above us.&rsquo; He swept his
  hand across the sky. &lsquo;Yet there are those,&rsquo; he went on sourly, &lsquo;who
  have years without knowledge.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Right,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;No fool like an old fool.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Culpeper wrapped his cloak round him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id=
  "Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> and sat still while the children stared at the Great
  Bear on the hill-top.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Give him time,&rsquo; Puck whispered behind his hand. &lsquo;He turns like a
  timber-tug&mdash;all of a piece.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ahem!&rsquo; Mr. Culpeper said suddenly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it to you.
  When I was physician to Saye&rsquo;s Horse, and fought the King&mdash;or rather the man
  Charles Stuart&mdash;in Oxfordshire (I had <i>my</i> learning at Cambridge), the plague
  was very hot all around us. I saw it at close hands. He who says I am ignorant of the
  plague, for example, is altogether beside the bridge.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We grant it,&rsquo; said Puck solemnly. &lsquo;But why talk of the plague
  this rare night?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;To prove my argument. This Oxfordshire plague, good people, being generated
  among rivers and ditches, was of a werish, watery nature. Therefore it was curable by
  drenching the patient in cold water, and laying him in wet cloths; or at least, so I
  cured some of them. Mark this. It bears on what shall come after.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mark also, Nick,&rsquo; said Puck, &lsquo;that we are not your College of
  Physicians, but only a lad and a lass and a poor lubberkin. Therefore be plain, old
  Hyssop on the Wall!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;To be plain and in order with you, I was shot in the chest while gathering of
  betony from a brookside near Thame, and was took by the King&rsquo;s men before their
  Colonel, one Blagg or Bragge, whom I warned honestly that I had spent the week past
  among our plague-stricken. He flung me off into a cowshed, much like this here, to
  die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> as I
  supposed; but one of their priests crept in by night and dressed my wound. He was a
  Sussex man like myself.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Who was that?&rsquo; said Puck suddenly. &lsquo;Zack Tutshom?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No, Jack Marget,&rsquo; said Mr. Culpeper.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Jack Marget of New College? The little merry man that stammered so? Why a
  plague was stuttering Jack at Oxford then?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He had come out of Sussex in hope of being made a Bishop when the King should
  have conquered the rebels, as he styled us Parliament men. His College had lent the
  King some monies too, which they never got again, no more than simple Jack got his
  bishopric. When we met he had had a bitter bellyful of King&rsquo;s promises, and
  wished to return to his wife and babes. This came about beyond expectation, for, so
  soon as I could stand of my wound the man Blagge made excuse that I had been among the
  plague, and Jack had been tending me, to thrust us both out from their camp. The King
  had done with Jack now that Jack&rsquo;s College had lent the money, and Blagge&rsquo;s
  physician could not abide me because I would not sit silent and see him butcher the
  sick. (He was a College of Physicians man!) So Blagge, I say, thrust us both out, with
  many vile words, for a pair of pestilent, prating, pragmatical rascals.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ha! Called <i>you</i> pragmatical, Nick?&rsquo; Puck started up. &lsquo;High
  time Oliver came to purge the land! How did you and honest Jack fare next?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We were in some sort constrained to each<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> other&rsquo;s company. I was for going to
  my house in Spitalfields, he would go to his parish in Sussex; but the plague was broke
  out and spreading through Wiltshire, Berkshire, and Hampshire, and he was so mad
  distracted to think that it might even then be among his folks at home that I bore him
  company. He had comforted me in my distress. I could not have done less; and I
  remembered that I had a cousin at Great Wigsell, near by Jack&rsquo;s parish. Thus we
  footed it from Oxford, cassock and buff coat together, resolute to leave wars on the
  left side henceforth; and either through our mean appearances, or the plague making men
  less cruel, we were not hindered. To be sure they put us in the stocks one half-day for
  rogues and vagabonds at a village under St. Leonard&rsquo;s forest, where, as I have
  heard, nightingales never sing; but the constable very honestly gave me back my
  Astrological Almanac, which I carry with me.&rsquo; Mr. Culpeper tapped his thin chest.
  &lsquo;I dressed a whitlow on his thumb. So we went forward.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not to trouble you with impertinences, we fetched over against Jack
  Marget&rsquo;s parish in a storm of rain about the day&rsquo;s end. Here our roads
  divided, for I would have gone on to my cousin at Great Wigsell, but while Jack was
  pointing me out his steeple, we saw a man lying drunk, as he conceived, athwart the
  road. He said it would be one Hebden, a parishioner, and till then a man of good life;
  and he accused himself bitterly for an unfaithful shepherd, that had left his flock to
  follow princes. But I saw it was the plague, and not the beginnings of it neither. They
  had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> set out
  the plague-stone, and the man&rsquo;s head lay on it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a plague-stone?&rsquo; Dan whispered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When the plague is so hot in a village that the neighbours shut the roads
  against &rsquo;em, people set a hollowed stone, pot, or pan, where such as would
  purchase victual from outside may lay money and the paper of their wants, and depart.
  Those that would sell come later&mdash;what will a man not do for gain?&mdash;snatch
  the money forth, and leave in exchange such goods as their conscience reckons fair
  value. I saw a silver groat in the water, and the man&rsquo;s list of what he would buy
  was rain-pulped in his wet hand.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My wife! Oh, my wife and babes!&rdquo; says Jack of a sudden, and
  makes up-hill&mdash;I with him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A woman peers out from behind a barn, crying out that the village is stricken
  with the plague, and that for our lives&rsquo; sake we must avoid it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sweetheart!&rdquo; says Jack. &ldquo;Must I avoid thee?&rdquo; and she
  leaps at him and says the babes are safe. She was his wife.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When he had thanked God, even to tears, he tells me this was not the welcome
  he had intended, and presses me to flee the place while I was clean.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nay! The Lord do so to me and more also if I desert thee now,&rdquo; I
  said. "These affairs are, under God&rsquo;s leave, in some fashion my
  strength.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;are you a physician? We have
  none.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then, good people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I must e&rsquo;en justify
  myself to you by my works."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg
  262]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Look&mdash;look ye,&rdquo; stammers Jack, &ldquo;I took you all this
  time for a crazy Roundhead preacher.&rdquo; He laughs, and she, and then I&mdash;all
  three together in the rain are overtook by an unreasonable gust or clap of laughter,
  which none the less eased us. We call it in medicine the Hysterical Passion. So I went
  home with &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why did you not go on to your cousin at Great Wigsell, Nick?&rsquo; Puck
  suggested. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis barely seven mile up the road.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But the plague was here,&rsquo; Mr. Culpeper answered, and pointed up the
  hill. &lsquo;What else could I have done?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What were the parson&rsquo;s children called?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Elizabeth, Alison, Stephen, and Charles&mdash;a babe. I scarce saw them at
  first, for I separated to live with their father in a cart-lodge. The mother we
  put&mdash;forced&mdash;into the house with her babes. She had done enough.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And now, good people, give me leave to be particular in this case. The plague
  was worst on the north side of the street, for lack, as I showed &rsquo;em, of
  sunshine; which, proceeding from the <i>primum mobile</i>, or source of life (I speak
  astrologically), is cleansing and purifying in the highest degree. The plague was hot
  too by the corn-chandler&rsquo;s, where they sell forage to the carters; extreme hot in
  both Mills along the river, and scatteringly in other places, <i>except</i>, mark you,
  at the smithy. Mark here, that all forges and smith-shops belong to Mars, even as corn
  and meat and wine-shops acknowledge Venus for their<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> mistress. There was no plague in the
  smithy at Munday&rsquo;s Lane&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Munday&rsquo;s Lane? You mean our village? I thought so when you talked about
  the two Mills,&rsquo; cried Dan. &lsquo;Where did we put the plague-stone? I&rsquo;d
  like to have seen it.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then look at it now,&rsquo; said Puck, and pointed to the chickens&rsquo;
  drinking-trough where they had set their bicycle lamps. It was a rough, oblong stone
  pan, rather like a small kitchen sink, which Phillips, who never wastes anything, had
  found in a ditch and had used for his precious hens.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That?&rsquo; said Dan and Una, and stared, and stared, and stared.</p>

  <p>Mr. Culpeper made impatient noises in his throat and went on.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I am at these pains to be particular, good people, because I would have you
  follow, so far as you may, the operations of my mind. That plague which I told you I
  had handled outside Wallingford in Oxfordshire was of a watery nature, conformable to
  the brookish riverine country it bred in, and curable, as I have said, by drenching in
  water. This plague of ours here, for all that it flourished along
  watercourses&mdash;every soul at both Mills died of it,&mdash;could not be so handled.
  Which brought me to a stand. Ahem!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And your sick people in the meantime?&rsquo; Puck demanded.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We persuaded them on the north side of the street to lie out in
  Hitheram&rsquo;s field. Where the plague had taken one, or at most two, in a house,
  folk would not shift for fear of thieves in their<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> absence. They cast away their lives to die
  among their goods.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Human nature,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it time and again. How
  did your sick do in the fields?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They died not near so thick as those that kept within doors, and even then
  they died more out of distraction and melancholy than plague. But I confess, good
  people, I could not in any sort master the sickness, or come at a glimmer of its nature
  or governance. To be brief, I was flat bewildered at the brute malignity of the
  disease, and so&mdash;did what I should have done before&mdash;dismissed all
  conjectures and apprehensions that had grown up within me, chose a good hour by my
  Almanac, clapped my vinegar-cloth to my face, and entered some empty houses, resigned
  to wait upon the stars for guidance.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;At night? Were you not horribly frightened?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I dared to hope that the God who hath made man so nobly curious to search out
  His mysteries might not destroy a devout seeker. In due time&mdash;there is a time, as
  I have said, for everything under the sun&mdash;I spied a whitish rat, very puffed and
  scabby, which sat beneath the dormer of an attic through which shined our Lady the
  Moon. Whilst I looked on him&mdash;and her&mdash;she was moving towards old cold
  Saturn, her ancient ally&mdash;the rat creeped languishingly into her light, and there,
  before my eyes, died. Presently his mate or companion came out, laid him down beside
  there, and in like fashion died too. Later&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> hour or less to midnight&mdash;a third rat
  did e&rsquo;en the same; always choosing the moonlight to die in. This threw me into an
  amaze, since, as we know, the moonlight is favourable, not hurtful, to the creatures of
  the Moon; and Saturn, being friends with her, as you would say, was hourly
  strengthening her evil influence. Yet these three rats had been stricken dead in very
  moonlight. I leaned out of the window to see which of Heaven&rsquo;s host might be on
  our side, and there beheld I good trusty Mars, very red and heated, bustling about his
  setting. I straddled the roof to see better.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Jack Marget came up street going to comfort our sick in Hitheram&rsquo;s
  field. A tile slipped under my foot.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Says he heavily enough, &ldquo;Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>"Heart up, Jack,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Methinks there&rsquo;s one fighting for us
  that, like a fool, I&rsquo;ve forgot all this summer.&rdquo; My meaning was naturally
  the planet Mars.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pray to Him then,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I forgot Him too this
  summer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He meant God, whom he always bitterly accused himself of having forgotten up
  in Oxfordshire, among the King&rsquo;s men. I called down that he had made amends
  enough for his sin by his work among the sick, but he said he would not believe so till
  the plague was lifted from &rsquo;em. He was at his strength&rsquo;s end&mdash;more
  from melancholy than any just cause. I have seen this before among priests and
  over-cheerful men. I drenched him then and there with a half cup of waters,<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> which I do not say cure
  the plague, but are excellent against heaviness of the spirits.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What were they?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;White brandy rectified, camphor, cardamoms, ginger, two sorts of pepper, and
  aniseed.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;Waters you call &rsquo;em!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Jack coughed on it valiantly, and went down hill with me. I was for the Lower
  Mill in the valley, to note the aspect of the Heavens. My mind had already shadowed
  forth the reason, if not the remedy, for our troubles, but I would not impart it to the
  vulgar till I was satisfied. That practice may be perfect, judgment ought to be sound,
  and to make judgment sound is required an exquisite knowledge. Ahem! I left Jack and
  his lantern among the sick in Hitheram&rsquo;s field. He still maintained the prayers
  of the so-called Church, which were rightly forbidden by Cromwell.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You should have told your cousin at Wigsell,&rsquo; said Puck, &lsquo;and
  Jack would have been fined for it, and you&rsquo;d have had half the money. How did you
  come so to fail in your duty, Nick?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Culpeper laughed&mdash;his only laugh that evening&mdash;and the children jumped
  at the loud neigh of it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We were not fearful of <i>men&rsquo;s</i> judgment in those days,&rsquo; he
  answered. &lsquo;Now mark me closely, good people, for what follows will be to you,
  though not to me, remarkable. When I reached the empty Mill, old Saturn, low down in
  the House of the Fishes, threatened the Sun&rsquo;s rising-place. Our Lady the Moon was
  moving towards the help of him (understand, I speak astrologically).<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> I looked abroad upon the
  high Heavens, and I prayed the Maker of &rsquo;em for guidance. Now Mars sparklingly
  withdrew himself below the sky. On the instant of his departure, which I noted, a
  bright star or vapour leaped forth above his head (as though he had heaved up his
  sword), and broke all about in fire. The cocks crowed midnight through the valley, and
  I sat me down by the mill-wheel, chewing spearmint (though that&rsquo;s a herb of
  Venus), and calling myself all the asses&rsquo; heads in the world! &lsquo;Twas plain
  enough <i>now</i>!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What was plain?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The true cause and cure of the plague. Mars, good fellow, had fought for us
  to the uttermost. Faint though he had been in the Heavens, and this had made me
  overlook him in my computations, he more than any of the other planets had kept the
  Heavens&mdash;which is to say, had been visible some part of each night wellnigh
  throughout the year. Therefore his fierce and cleansing influence, warring against the
  Moon, had stretched out to kill those three rats under my nose, and under the nose of
  their natural mistress, the Moon. I had known Mars lean half across Heaven to deal our
  Lady the Moon some shrewd blow from under his shield, but I had never before seen his
  strength displayed so effectual.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand a bit. Do you mean Mars killed the rats because he
  hated the Moon?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>That</i> is as plain as the pikestaff with which Blagge&rsquo;s men pushed
  me forth,&rsquo; Mr. Culpeper answered. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it. Why had the
  plague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> not
  broken out at the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop in Munday&rsquo;s Lane? Because, as
  I&rsquo;ve shown you, forges and smithies belong naturally to Mars, and, for his
  honour&rsquo;s sake, Mars &rsquo;ud keep &rsquo;em clean from the creatures of the
  Moon. But was it like, think you, that he&rsquo;d come down and rat-catch in general
  for lazy, ungrateful mankind? That were working a willing horse to death. So then you
  can see that the meaning of the blazing star above him when he set was simply this:
  &ldquo;Destroy and burn the creatures of the Moon, for they are at the root of your
  trouble. And thus, having shown you a taste of my power, good people,
  adieu."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Did Mars really say all that?&rsquo; Una whispered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and twice so much as that to any one who had ears to hear. Briefly, he
  enlightened me that the plague was spread by the creatures of the Moon. The Moon, our
  Lady of Ill-aspect, was the offender. My own poor wits showed me that I, Nick Culpeper,
  had the people in my charge, God&rsquo;s good providence aiding me, and no time to lose
  neither.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I posted up the hill, and broke into Hitheram&rsquo;s field amongst &rsquo;em
  all at prayers.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Eureka, good people!&rdquo; I cried, and cast down a dead mill-rat
  which I&rsquo;d found. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your true enemy, revealed at last by the
  stars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nay, but I&rsquo;m praying,&rdquo; says Jack. His face was as white as
  washed silver.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a time for everything under the sun,&rdquo; says I.
  &ldquo;If you would stay the plague, take and kill your rats."<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, mad, stark mad!&rdquo; says he, and wrings his hands.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A fellow lay in the ditch beside him, who bellows that he&rsquo;d as soon die
  mad hunting rats as be preached to death on a cold fallow. They laughed round him at
  this, but Jack Marget falls on his knees, and very presumptuously petitions that he may
  be appointed to die to save the rest of his people. This was enough to thrust &rsquo;em
  back into their melancholy.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are an unfaithful shepherd, Jack,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Take a
  bat&rdquo; (which we call a stick in Sussex) &ldquo;and kill a rat if you die before
  sunrise. &rsquo;Twill save your people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Aye, aye. Take a bat and kill a rat,&rdquo; he says ten times over,
  like a child, which moved &rsquo;em to ungovernable motions of that hysterical passion
  before mentioned, so that they laughed all, and at least warmed their chill bloods at
  that very hour&mdash;one o&rsquo;clock or a little after&mdash;when the fires of life
  burn lowest. Truly there is a time for everything; and the physician must work with
  it&mdash;ahem!&mdash;or miss his cure. To be brief with you, I persuaded &rsquo;em,
  sick or sound, to have at the whole generation of rats throughout the village. And
  there&rsquo;s a reason for all things too, though the wise physician need not blab
  &rsquo;em all. <i>Imprimis</i>, or firstly, the mere sport of it, which lasted ten
  days, drew &rsquo;em most markedly out of their melancholy. I&rsquo;d defy sorrowful
  Job himself to lament or scratch while he&rsquo;s routing rats from a rick.
  <i>Secundo</i>, or secondly, the vehement act and operation of this chase or war opened
  their skins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
  to generous transpiration&mdash;more vulgarly, sweated &rsquo;em handsomely; and this
  further drew off their black bile&mdash;the mother of sickness. Thirdly, when we came
  to burn the bodies of the rats, I sprinkled sulphur on the faggots, whereby the
  onlookers were as handsomely suffumigated. This I could not have compassed if I had
  made it a mere physician&rsquo;s business; they&rsquo;d have thought it some
  conjuration. Yet more, we cleansed, limed, and burned out a hundred foul poke-holes,
  sinks, slews, and corners of unvisited filth in and about the houses in the village,
  and by good fortune (mark here that Mars was in opposition to Venus) burned the
  corn-chandler&rsquo;s shop to the ground. Mars loves not Venus. Will Noakes the saddler
  dropped his lantern on a truss of straw while he was rat-hunting there.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Had ye given Will any of that gentle cordial of yours, Nick, by any
  chance?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A glass&mdash;or two glasses&mdash;not more. But as I would say, in fine,
  when we had killed the rats, I took ash, slag, and charcoal from the smithy, and burnt
  earth from the brickyard (I reason that a brickyard belongs to Mars), and rammed it
  with iron crowbars into the rat-runs and buries, and beneath all the house floors. The
  Creatures of the Moon hate all that Mars hath used for his own clean ends. For
  example&mdash;rats bite not iron.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And how did poor stuttering Jack endure it?&rsquo; said Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He sweated out his melancholy through his skin, and catched a loose cough,
  which I cured with electuaries, according to art. It is noteworthy,<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> were I speaking among my
  equals, that the venom of the plague translated, or turned itself into, and evaporated,
  or went away as, a very heavy hoarseness and thickness of the head, throat, and chest.
  (Observe from my books which planets govern these portions of man&rsquo;s body, and
  your darkness, good people, shall be illuminated&mdash;ahem!) None the less, the
  plague, <i>qua</i> plague, ceased and took off (for we only lost three more, and two of
  &rsquo;em had it already on &rsquo;em) from the morning of the day that Mars
  enlightened me by the Lower Mill.&rsquo; He coughed&mdash;almost
  trumpeted&mdash;triumphantly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It is proved,&rsquo; he jerked out. &lsquo;I say I have proved my contention,
  which is, that by Divine Astrology and humble search into the veritable causes of
  things&mdash;at the proper time&mdash;the sons of wisdom may combat even the
  plague.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; Puck replied. &lsquo;For my own part I hold that a simple
  soul&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mine?&mdash;simple, forsooth?&rsquo; said Mr. Culpeper.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A very simple soul, a high courage tempered with sound and stubborn conceit,
  is stronger than all the stars in their courses. So I confess truly that you saved the
  village, Nick.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I stubborn? I stiff-necked? I ascribed all my poor success, under God&rsquo;s
  good providence, to Divine Astrology. Not to me the glory! You talk as that dear
  weeping ass Jack Marget preached before I went back to my work in Red Lion House,
  Spitalfields.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh! Stammering Jack preached, did he? They say he loses his stammer in the
  pulpit.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg
  272]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;And his wits with it. He delivered a most idolatrous discourse when the
  plague was stayed. He took for his text: &ldquo;The wise man that delivered the
  city.&rdquo; I could have given him a better, such as: &ldquo;There is a time
  for&mdash;&mdash;"&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But what made you go to church to hear him?&rsquo; Puck interrupted.
  &lsquo;Wail Attersole was your lawfully appointed preacher, and a dull dog he
  was!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Culpeper wriggled uneasily.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The vulgar,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the old crones and&mdash;ahem&mdash;the
  children, Alison and the others, they dragged me to the House of Rimmon by the hand. I
  was in two minds to inform on Jack for maintaining the mummeries of the falsely called
  Church, which, I&rsquo;ll prove to you, are founded merely on ancient
  fables&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Stick to your herbs and planets,&rsquo; said Puck, laughing. &lsquo;You
  should have told the magistrates, Nick, and had Jack fined. Again, why did you neglect
  your plain duty?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Because&mdash;because I was kneeling, and praying, and weeping with the rest
  of &rsquo;em at the altar rails. In medicine this is called the Hysterical Passion. It
  may be&mdash;it may be.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rsquo; said Puck. They heard him turn the hay.
  &lsquo;Why, your hay is half hedge-brishings,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
  expect a horse to thrive on oak and ash and thorn leaves, do you?&rsquo;</p>
  <hr style="width: 45%;" />

  <p><i>Ping-ping-ping</i> went the bicycle bell round the corner. Nurse was coming back
  from the Mill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg
  273]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Is it all right?&rsquo; Una called.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;All quite right,&rsquo; Nurse called back. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re to be
  christened next Sunday.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What? What?&rsquo; They both leaned forward across the half-door. It could
  not have been properly fastened, for it opened, and tilted them out with hay and leaves
  sticking all over them.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Come on! We must get those two twins&rsquo; names,&rsquo; said Una, and they
  charged up-hill shouting over the hedge, till Nurse slowed up and told them.</p>

  <p>When they returned, old Middenboro had got out of his stall, and they spent a lively
  ten minutes chasing him in again by starlight.</p>

  <h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="Simple_Simon" id="Simple_Simon"></a>Simple Simon</h2>

  <p>Cattiwow came down the steep lane with his five-horse timber-tug. He stopped by the
  woodlump at the back gate to take off the brakes. His real name was Brabon, but the
  first time the children met him, years and years ago, he told them he was
  &lsquo;carting wood,&rsquo; and it sounded so exactly like &lsquo;cattiwow&rsquo; that
  they never called him anything else.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hi!&rsquo; Una shouted from the top of the woodlump, where they had been
  watching the lane. &lsquo;What are you doing? Why weren&rsquo;t we told?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve just sent for me,&rsquo; Cattiwow answered.
  &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a middlin&rsquo; big log sticked in the dirt at Rabbit Shaw,
  and&rsquo;&mdash;he flicked his whip back along the line&mdash;&rsquo;so they&rsquo;ve
  sent for us all.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Dan and Una threw themselves off the woodlump almost under black Sailor&rsquo;s
  nose. Cattiwow never let them ride the big beam that makes the body of the timber-tug,
  but they hung on behind while their teeth thuttered.</p>

  <p>The wood road beyond the brook climbs at once into the woods, and you see all the
  horses&rsquo; backs rising, one above another, like moving<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> stairs. Cattiwow strode
  ahead in his sackcloth woodman&rsquo;s petticoat, belted at the waist with a leather
  strap; and when he turned and grinned, his red lips showed under his sackcloth-coloured
  beard. His cap was sackcloth too, with a flap behind, to keep twigs and bark out of his
  neck. He navigated the tug among pools of heather-water that splashed in their faces,
  and through clumps of young birches that slashed at their legs, and when they hit an
  old toadstooled stump, they never knew whether it would give way in showers of rotten
  wood, or jar them back again.</p>

  <p>At the top of Rabbit Shaw half-a-dozen men and a team of horses stood round a
  forty-foot oak log in a muddy hollow. The ground about was poached and stoached with
  sliding hoof-marks, and a wave of dirt was driven up in front of the butt.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What did you want to bury her for this way?&rsquo; said Cattiwow. He took his
  broad-axe and went up the log tapping it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s sticked fast,&rsquo; said &lsquo;Bunny&rsquo; Lewknor, who
  managed the other team.</p>

  <p>Cattiwow unfastened the five wise horses from the tug. They cocked their ears
  forward, looked, and shook themselves.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I believe Sailor knows,&rsquo; Dan whispered to Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He do,&rsquo; said a man behind them. He was dressed in flour sacks like the
  others, and he leaned on his broad-axe, but the children, who knew all the wood gangs,
  knew he was a stranger. In his size and oily hairiness he might have been Bunny
  Lewknor&rsquo;s brother, except that his brown eyes were as soft as a spaniel&rsquo;s,
  and his rounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg
  283]</a></span> black beard, beginning close up under them, reminded Una of the walrus
  in <i>The Walrus and the Carpenter</i>.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t he just about know?&rsquo; he said shyly, and shifted from one
  foot to the other.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes. &ldquo;What Cattiwow can&rsquo;t get out of the woods must have roots
  growing to her"&rsquo;&mdash;Dan had heard old Hobden say this a few days before.</p>

  <p>At that minute Puck pranced up, picking his way through the pools of black water in
  the ling.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Look <i>out</i>!&rsquo; cried Una, jumping forward. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll see
  you, Puck!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Me and Mus&rsquo; Robin are pretty middlin&rsquo; well acquainted,&rsquo; the
  man answered with a smile that made them forget all about walruses.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;This is Simon Cheyneys,&rsquo; Puck began, and cleared his throat.
  &lsquo;Shipbuilder of Rye Port; burgess of the said town, and the
  only&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, look! Look ye! That&rsquo;s a knowing one,&rsquo; said the man. Cattiwow
  had fastened his team to the thin end of the log, and was moving them about with his
  whip till they stood at right angles to it, heading downhill. Then he grunted. The
  horses took the strain, beginning with Sailor next the log, like a tug-of-war team, and
  dropped almost to their knees. The log shifted a nail&rsquo;s breadth in the clinging
  dirt, with the noise of a giant&rsquo;s kiss.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re getting her!&rsquo; Simon Cheyneys slapped his knee. &lsquo;Hing
  on! Hing on, lads, or she&rsquo;ll master ye! Ah!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Sailor&rsquo;s left hind hoof had slipped on a heather-tuft.<span class=

  off his sack apron and spread it down. They saw Sailor feel for it, and recover. Still
  the log hung, and the team grunted in despair.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hai!&rsquo; shouted Cattiwow, and brought his dreadful whip twice across
  Sailor&rsquo;s loins with the crack of a shot-gun. The horse almost screamed as he
  pulled that extra last ounce which he did not know was in him. The thin end of the log
  left the dirt and rasped on dry gravel. The butt ground round like a buffalo in his
  wallow. Quick as an axe-cut, Lewknor snapped on his five horses, and sliding,
  trampling, jingling, and snorting, they had the whole thing out on the heather.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Dat&rsquo;s the very first time I&rsquo;ve knowed you lay into
  Sailor&mdash;to hurt him,&rsquo; said Lewknor.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; said Cattiwow, and passed his hand over the two wheals.
  &lsquo;But I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; laid my own brother open at that pinch. Now we&rsquo;ll
  twitch her down the hill a piece&mdash;she lies just about right&mdash;and get her home
  by the low road. My team&rsquo;ll do it, Bunny; you bring the tug along. Mind
  out!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He spoke to the horses, who tightened the chains. The great log half rolled over,
  and slowly drew itself out of sight downhill, followed by the wood gang and the
  timber-tug. In half a minute there was nothing to see but the deserted hollow of the
  torn-up dirt, the birch undergrowth still shaking, and the water draining back into the
  hoof-prints.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ye heard him?&rsquo; Simon Cheyneys asked. &lsquo;He<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> cherished his horse, but
  he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; laid him open in that pinch.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not for his own advantage,&rsquo; said Puck quickly. &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas only
  to shift the log.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I reckon every man born of woman has his log to shift in the world&mdash;if
  so be you&rsquo;re hintin&rsquo; at any o&rsquo; Frankie&rsquo;s doings. <i>He</i>
  never hit beyond reason or without reason,&rsquo; said Simon.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> never said a word against Frankie,&rsquo; Puck retorted, with a wink
  at the children. &lsquo;An&rsquo; if I did, do it lie in your mouth to contest my
  say-so, seeing how you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t it lie in my mouth, seeing I was the first which knowed
  Frankie for all he was?&rsquo; The burly sack-clad man puffed down at cool little
  Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and the first which set out to poison him&mdash;Frankie&mdash;on the
  high seas&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Simon&rsquo;s angry face changed to a sheepish grin. He waggled his immense hands,
  but Puck stood off and laughed mercilessly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But let me tell you, Mus&rsquo; Robin,&rsquo; he pleaded.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the tale. Tell the children here. Look, Dan! Look,
  Una!&rsquo;&mdash;Puck&rsquo;s straight brown finger levelled like an arrow.
  &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the only man that ever tried to poison Sir Francis
  Drake!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Mus&rsquo; Robin! Tidn&rsquo;t fair. You&rsquo;ve the &lsquo;vantage of
  us all in your upbringin&rsquo;s by hundreds o&rsquo; years. &lsquo;Stands to nature
  you know all the tales against every one.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He turned his soft eyes so helplessly on Una that she cried, &lsquo;Stop ragging
  him, Puck! You know he didn&rsquo;t really.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I do. But why are you so sure, little maid?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Because&mdash;because he doesn&rsquo;t look like it,&rsquo; said Una
  stoutly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I thank you,&rsquo; said Simon to Una. &lsquo;I&mdash;I was always trustable
  like with children if you let me alone, you double handful o&rsquo; mischief!&rsquo; He
  pretended to heave up his axe on Puck; and then his shyness overtook him afresh.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Where did you know Sir Francis Drake?&rsquo; said Dan, not relishing being
  called a child.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;At Rye Port, to be sure,&rsquo; said Simon, and seeing Dan&rsquo;s
  bewilderment, repeated it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, but look here,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;Drake he was a Devon man. The
  song says so.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;<i>And</i> ruled the Devon seas,"&rsquo; Una went on.
  &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Simon Cheyneys seemed to mind very much indeed, for he swelled in silence while Puck
  laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hutt!&rsquo; he burst out at last, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that talk too. If
  you listen to them West Country folk, you&rsquo;ll listen to a pack o&rsquo; lies. I
  believe Frankie was born somewhere out west among the Shires, but his father had to run
  for it when Frankie was a baby, because the neighbours was wishful to kill him,
  d&rsquo;ye see? He run to Chatham, old Parson Drake did, an&rsquo; Frankie was brought
  up in a old hulks of a ship moored in the Medway river, same as it might ha&rsquo; been
  the Rother. Brought up <i>at</i> sea, you might say, before he could walk <i>on</i>
  land&mdash;nigh Chatham in Kent. And ain&rsquo;t Kent back-door to Sussex? And
  don&rsquo;t that make Frankie Sussex? O&rsquo; course it do. Devon man!<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> Bah! Those West Country
  boats they&rsquo;re always fishin&rsquo; in other folks&rsquo; water.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;No call to be sorry. You&rsquo;ve been misled. I met Frankie at Rye Port when
  my Uncle, that was the shipbuilder there, pushed me off his wharf-edge on to
  Frankie&rsquo;s ship. Frankie had put in from Chatham with his rudder splutted, and a
  man&rsquo;s arm&mdash;Moon&rsquo;s that &rsquo;ud be&mdash;broken at the tiller. "Take
  this boy aboard an&rsquo; drown him,&rdquo; says my Uncle, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll mend
  your rudder-piece for love."&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What did your Uncle want you drowned for?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That was only his fashion of say-so, same as Mus&rsquo; Robin. I&rsquo;d a
  foolishness in my head that ships could be builded out of iron. Yes&mdash;iron ships!
  I&rsquo;d made me a liddle toy one of iron plates beat out thin&mdash;and she floated a
  wonder! But my Uncle, bein&rsquo; a burgess of Rye, and a shipbuilder, he
  &rsquo;prenticed me to Frankie in the fetchin&rsquo; trade, to cure this
  foolishness.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What was the fetchin&rsquo; trade?&rsquo; Dan interrupted.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Fetchin&rsquo; poor Flemishers and Dutchmen out o&rsquo; the Low Countries
  into England. The King o&rsquo; Spain, d&rsquo;ye see, he was burnin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
  in those parts, for to make &rsquo;em Papishers, so Frankie he fetched &rsquo;em away
  to <i>our</i> parts, and a risky trade it was. His master wouldn&rsquo;t never touch it
  while he lived, but he left his ship to Frankie when he died, and Frankie turned her
  into this fetchin&rsquo; trade. Outrageous cruel hard work&mdash;on besom black nights
  bulting back and forth off they Dutch roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id=
  "Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> with shoals on all sides, and having to hark out for the
  <i>frish-frish-frish</i>-like of a Spanish galliwopses&rsquo; oars creepin&rsquo; up on
  ye. Frankie &rsquo;ud have the tiller and Moon he&rsquo;d peer forth at the bows, our
  lantern under his skirts, till the boat we was lookin&rsquo; for &rsquo;ud blurt up out
  o&rsquo; the dark, and we&rsquo;d lay hold and haul aboard whoever
  &rsquo;twas&mdash;man, woman, or babe,&mdash;an&rsquo; round we&rsquo;d go again, the
  wind bewling like a kite in our riggin&rsquo;s, and they&rsquo;d drop into the hold and
  praise God for happy deliverance till they was all sick.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I had nigh a year at it, an&rsquo; we must have fetched off&mdash;oh, a
  hundred pore folk, I reckon. Outrageous bold, too, Frankie growed to be. Outrageous
  cunning he was. Once we was as near as nothing nipped by a tall ship off Tergo Sands in
  a snowstorm. She had the wind of us, and spooned straight before it, shooting all bow
  guns. Frankie fled inshore smack for the beach, till he was atop of the first breakers.
  Then he hove his anchor out, which nigh tore our bows off, but it twitched us round
  end-for-end into the wind, d&rsquo;ye see, an&rsquo; we clawed off them sands like a
  drunk man rubbin&rsquo; along a tavern bench. When we could see, the Spanisher was laid
  flat along in the breakers with the snows whitening on his wet belly. He thought he
  could go where Frankie went.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What happened to the crew?&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t stop,&rsquo; Simon answered. &lsquo;There was a very liddle
  new baby in our hold, and the mother, she wanted to get to some dry bed middlin&rsquo;
  quick. We runned into Dover, and said nothing.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Was Sir Francis Drake very much pleased?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Heart alive, maid, he&rsquo;d no head to his name in those days. He was just
  a outrageous, valiant, crop-haired, tutt-mouthed boy roarin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down
  the narrer seas, with his beard not yet quilled out. He made a laughing-stock of
  everything all day, and he&rsquo;d hold our lives in the bight of his arm all the
  besom-black night among they Dutch sands; and we&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; jumped overside to
  behove him any one time, all of us.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then why did you try to poison him?&rsquo; Una asked wickedly, and Simon hung
  his head like a shy child.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that was when he set me to make a pudden, for because our cook was
  hurted. <i>I</i> done my uttermost, but she all fetched adrift like in the bag,
  an&rsquo; the more I biled the bits of her, the less she favoured any fashion o&rsquo;
  pudden. Moon he chawed and chammed his piece, and Frankie chawed and chammed
  his&rsquo;n, and&mdash;no words to it&mdash;he took me by the ear an&rsquo; walked me
  out over the bow-end, an&rsquo; him an&rsquo; Moon hove the pudden at me on the
  bowsprit gub by gub, something cruel hard!&rsquo; Simon rubbed his hairy cheek.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nex&rsquo; time you bring me anything,&rdquo; says Frankie, &ldquo;you
  bring me cannon-shot an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;m getting.&rdquo; But as
  for poisoning&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo; He stopped, the children laughed so.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Oh, Simon, we <i>do</i>
  like you!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I was always likeable with children.&rsquo; His smile crinkled up through the
  hair round his eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg
  290]</a></span> &lsquo;Simple Simon they used to call me through our yard
  gates.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Did Sir Francis mock you?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah, no. He was gentle-born. Laugh he did&mdash;he was always
  laughing&mdash;but not so as to hurt a feather. An&rsquo; I loved &rsquo;en. I loved
  &rsquo;en before England knew &rsquo;en, or Queen Bess she broke his heart.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But he hadn&rsquo;t really done anything when you knew him, had he?&rsquo;
  Una insisted. &lsquo;Armadas and those things, I mean.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Simon pointed to the scars and scrapes left by Cattiwow&rsquo;s great log.
  &lsquo;You tell me that that good ship&rsquo;s timber never done nothing against winds
  and weathers since her upspringing, and I&rsquo;ll confess ye that young Frankie never
  done nothing neither. Nothing? He adventured and suffered and made shift on they Dutch
  sands <i>as</i> much in any one month as ever he had occasion for to do in a half-year
  on the high seas afterwards. An&rsquo; what was his tools? A coaster boat&mdash;a
  liddle box o&rsquo; walty plankin&rsquo; an&rsquo; some few fathom feeble rope held
  together an&rsquo; made able by <i>him</i> sole. He drawed our spirits up in our bodies
  same as a chimney-towel draws a fire. &lsquo;Twas in him, and it comed out all times
  and shapes.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I wonder did he ever &rsquo;magine what he was going to be? Tell himself
  stories about it?&rsquo; said Dan with a flush.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I expect so. We mostly do&mdash;even when we&rsquo;re grown. But bein&rsquo;
  Frankie, he took good care to find out beforehand what his fortune might be. Had I
  rightly ought to tell &rsquo;em this piece?&rsquo; Simon turned to Puck, who
  nodded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;My mother, she was just a fair woman, but my Aunt, her sister, she had gifts
  by inheritance laid up in her,&rsquo; Simon began.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll never do,&rsquo; cried Puck, for the children stared
  blankly. &lsquo;Do you remember what Robin promised to the Widow Whitgift so long as
  her blood and get lasted?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes. There was always to be one of them that could see farther through a
  millstone than most,&rsquo; Dan answered promptly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Well, Simon&rsquo;s Aunt&rsquo;s mother,&rsquo; said Puck slowly,
  &lsquo;married the Widow&rsquo;s blind son on the Marsh, and Simon&rsquo;s Aunt was the
  one chosen to see farthest through millstones. Do you understand?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That was what I was gettin&rsquo; at,&rsquo; said Simon, &lsquo;but
  you&rsquo;re so desperate quick. My Aunt she knew what was coming to people. My Uncle
  being a burgess of Rye, he counted all such things odious, and my Aunt she
  couldn&rsquo;t be got to practise her gifts hardly at all, because it hurted her head
  for a week afterwards; but when Frankie heard she had &rsquo;em, he was all for nothing
  till she foretold on him&mdash;till she looked in his hand to tell his fortune,
  d&rsquo;ye see? One time we was at Rye she come aboard with my other shirt and some
  apples, and he fair beazled the life out of her about it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll be twice wed, and die childless,&rdquo; she says, and
  pushes his hand away.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the woman&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; he says.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll come to me&mdash;to me?&rdquo; an&rsquo; he thrusts it back under
  her nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Gold&mdash;gold, past belief or counting,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Let
  go &rsquo;o me, lad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sink the gold!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I <i>do</i>,
  mother?&rdquo; He coaxed her like no woman could well withstand. I&rsquo;ve seen him
  with &rsquo;em&mdash;even when they were sea-sick.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If you <i>will</i> have it,&rdquo; she says at last, &ldquo;you shall
  have it. You&rsquo;ll do a many things, and eating and drinking with a dead man beyond
  the world&rsquo;s end will be the least of them. For you&rsquo;ll open a road from the
  East unto the West, and back again, and you&rsquo;ll bury your heart with your best
  friend by that road-side, and the road you open none shall shut so long as you&rsquo;re
  let lie quiet in your grave."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And if I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo; he says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;Sim&rsquo;s iron ships will be
  sailing on dry land. Now ha&rsquo; done with this foolishness. Where&rsquo;s
  Sim&rsquo;s shirt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t fetch no more out of her, and when we come up from the
  cabin, he stood mazed like by the tiller, playing with a apple.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My Sorrow!&rdquo; says my Aunt; &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye see that? The great
  world lying in his hand, liddle and round like a apple.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;tis one you gived him,&rdquo; I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis just a apple,&rdquo;
  and she went ashore with her hand to her head. It always hurted her to show her
  gifts.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Him and me puzzled over that talk plenty. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>It sticked in his mind quite extravagant.
  The very next time we slipped out for some fetchin&rsquo; trade, we met Mus&rsquo;
  Stenning&rsquo;s boat over by Calais sands; and he warned us that the Spanishers had
  shut down all their Dutch ports against us English, and their galliwopses was out
  picking up our boats like flies off hogs&rsquo; backs. Mus&rsquo; Stenning he runs for
  Shoreham, but Frankie held on a piece, knowin&rsquo; that Mus&rsquo; Stenning was
  jealous of our good trade. Over by Dunkirk a great gor-bellied Spanisher, with the
  Cross on his sails, came rampin&rsquo; at us. We left him. We left him all they bare
  seas to conquest in.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Looks like this road was going to be shut pretty soon,&rdquo; says
  Frankie, humouring her at the tiller. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to open that other one
  your Aunt foretold of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The Spanisher&rsquo;s crowdin&rsquo; down on us middlin&rsquo;
  quick,&rdquo; I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No odds,&rdquo; says Frankie, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have the inshore tide
  against him. Did your Aunt say I was to lie quiet in my grave for ever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Till my iron ships sailed dry land,&rdquo; I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s foolishness,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Who cares where
  Frankie Drake makes a hole in the water now or twenty years from now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Spanisher kept muckin&rsquo; on more and more canvas. I told him so.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo; the tide,&rdquo; was all he says. &ldquo;If
  he was among Tergoes Sands with this wind, we&rsquo;d be picking his bones proper.
  I&rsquo;d give my heart to have all their tall ships there some night before a north
  gale, and me to windward. There&rsquo;d be gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294"
  id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> in my hands then. Did your Aunt say she saw the world
  settin&rsquo; in my hand, Sim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, but &rsquo;twas a apple,&rdquo; says I, and he laughed like he
  always did at me. &ldquo;Do you ever feel minded to jump overside and be done with
  everything?&rdquo; he asks after a while.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No. What water comes aboard is too wet as &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; I says.
  &ldquo;The Spanisher&rsquo;s going about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; says he, never looking back. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
  give us the Pope&rsquo;s Blessing as he swings. Come down off that rail. There&rsquo;s
  no knowin&rsquo; where stray shots may hit.&rdquo; So I came down off the rail, and
  leaned against it, and the Spanisher he ruffled round in the wind, and his port-lids
  opened all red inside.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;ll happen to my road if they don&rsquo;t let me lie
  quiet in my grave?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Does your Aunt mean there&rsquo;s two roads
  to be found and kept open&mdash;or what does she mean? I don&rsquo;t like that talk
  about t&rsquo;other road. D&rsquo;you believe in your iron ships, Sim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He knowed I did, so I only nodded, and he nodded back again.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Anybody but me &rsquo;ud call you a fool, Sim,&rdquo; he says.
  &ldquo;Lie down. Here comes the Pope&rsquo;s Blessing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Spanisher gave us his broadside as he went about. They all fell short
  except one that smack-smooth hit the rail behind my back, an&rsquo; I felt most
  won&rsquo;erful cold.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Be you hit anywhere to signify?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Come over to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O Lord, Mus&rsquo; Drake,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;my legs<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> won&rsquo;t move,&rdquo;
  and that was the last I spoke for months.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why? What had happened?&rsquo; cried Dan and Una together.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The rail had jarred me in here like.&rsquo; Simon reached behind him
  clumsily. &lsquo;From my shoulders down I didn&rsquo;t act no shape. Frankie carried me
  piggy-back to my Aunt&rsquo;s house, and I lay bed-rid and tongue-tied while she rubbed
  me day and night, month in and month out. She had faith in rubbing with the hands.
  P&rsquo;raps she put some of her gifts into it, too. Last of all, something loosed
  itself in my pore back, and lo! I was whole restored again, but kitten-feeble.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Frankie?&rdquo; I says, thinking I&rsquo;d been a
  longish while abed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Down-wind amongst the Dons&mdash;months ago,&rdquo; says my Aunt.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;When can I go after &rsquo;en?&rdquo; I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Your duty&rsquo;s to your town and trade now,&rdquo; says she.
  &ldquo;Your Uncle he died last Michaelmas and he&rsquo;ve left you and me the yard. So
  no more iron ships, mind ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;And you the only one that beleft in
  &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Maybe I do still,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m a woman before
  I&rsquo;m a Whitgift, and wooden ships is what England needs us to build. I lay it on
  ye to do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve never teched iron since that day&mdash;not to
  build a toy ship of. I&rsquo;ve never even drawed a draft of one for my pleasure of
  evenings.&rsquo; Simon smiled down on them all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296"
  id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Whitgift blood is terrible resolute&mdash;on the she-side,&rsquo; said
  Puck.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever see Sir Francis Drake again?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;With one thing and another, and my being made a burgess of Rye, I never
  clapped eyes on him for the next twenty years. Oh, I had the news of his mighty doings
  the world over. They was the very same bold, cunning shifts and passes he&rsquo;d
  worked with beforetimes off they Dutch sands, but, naturally, folk took more note of
  them. When Queen Bess made him knight, he sent my Aunt a dried orange stuffed with
  spiceries to smell to. She cried outrageous on it. She blamed herself for her
  foretellings, having set him on his won&rsquo;erful road; but I reckon he&rsquo;d
  ha&rsquo; gone that way all withstanding. Curious how close she foretelled it! The
  world in his hand like an apple, an&rsquo; he burying his best friend, Mus&rsquo;
  Doughty&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Never mind for Mus&rsquo; Doughty,&rsquo; Puck interrupted. &lsquo;Tell us
  where you met Sir Francis next.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, ha! That was the year I was made a burgess of Rye&mdash;the same year
  which King Philip sent his ships to take England without Frankie&rsquo;s
  leave.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Armada!&rsquo; said Dan contentedly. &lsquo;I was hoping that would
  come.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> knowed Frankie would never let &rsquo;em smell London smoke, but
  plenty good men in Rye was two-three minded about the upshot. &lsquo;Twas the noise of
  the gun-fire terrified us. The wind favoured it our way from off behind the Isle
  of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> Wight. It
  made a mutter like, which growed and growed, and by the end of a week women was
  shruckin&rsquo; in the streets. Then <i>they</i> come sliddering past Fairlight in a
  great smoky pat vambrished with red gun-fire, and our ships flying forth and ducking in
  again. The smoke-pat sliddered over to the French shore, so I knowed Frankie was edging
  the Spanishers toward they Dutch sands where he was master. I says to my Aunt,
  &ldquo;The smoke&rsquo;s thinning out. I lay Frankie&rsquo;s just about scrapin&rsquo;
  his hold for a few last rounds shot. &lsquo;Tis time for me to go.&ldquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never in them clothes,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Do on the doublet I
  bought you to be made burgess in, and don&rsquo;t you shame this day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So I mucked it on, and my chain, and my stiffed Dutch breeches and all.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I be comin&rsquo;, too,&rdquo; she says from her chamber, and forth
  she come pavisanding like a peacock&mdash;stuff, ruff, stomacher and all. She was a
  notable woman.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But how did you go? You haven&rsquo;t told us,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;In my own ship&mdash;but half-share was my Aunt&rsquo;s. In the <i>Antony of
  Rye</i> to be sure; and not empty-handed. I&rsquo;d been loadin&rsquo; her for three
  days with the pick of our yard. We was ballasted on cannon-shot of all three sizes; and
  iron rods and straps for his carpenters; and a nice passel of clean three-inch oak
  planking and hide breech-ropes for his cannon, and gubs of good oakum, and bolts
  o&rsquo; canvas, and all the sound rope in the yard. What else could I ha&rsquo; done?
  <i>I</i> knowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg
  298]</a></span> what he&rsquo;d need most after a week&rsquo;s such work. I&rsquo;m a
  shipbuilder, little maid.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d a fair slant o&rsquo; wind off Dungeness, and we crept on till it
  fell light airs and puffed out. The Spanishers was all in a huddle over by Calais, and
  our ships was strawed about mending &rsquo;emselves like dogs lickin&rsquo; bites. Now
  and then a Spanisher would fire from a low port, and the ball &rsquo;ud troll across
  the flat swells, but both sides was finished fightin&rsquo; for that tide.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The first ship we foreslowed on, her breast-works was crushed in, an&rsquo;
  men was shorin&rsquo; &rsquo;em up. She said nothing. The next was a black pinnace, his
  pumps clackin&rsquo; middling quick, and he said nothing. But the third, mending shot
  holes, he spoke out plenty. I asked him where Mus&rsquo; Drake might be, and a
  shiny-suited man on the poop looked down into us, and saw what we carried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Lay alongside, you!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take that
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for Mus&rsquo; Drake,&rdquo; I says, keeping away lest his
  size should lee the wind out of my sails.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hi! Ho! Hither! We&rsquo;re Lord High Admiral of England! Come
  alongside, or we&rsquo;ll hang ye,&rdquo; he says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas none of my affairs who he was if he wasn&rsquo;t Frankie, and
  while he talked so hot I slipped behind a green-painted ship with her top-sides
  splintered. We was all in the middest of &rsquo;em then.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hi! Hoi!&rdquo; the green ship says. &ldquo;Come<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> alongside, honest man,
  and I&rsquo;ll buy your load. I&rsquo;m Fenner that fought the seven
  Portugals&mdash;clean out of shot or bullets. Frankie knows me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ay, but I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I says, and I slacked nothing.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He was a masterpiece. Seein&rsquo; I was for goin&rsquo; on, he hails a
  Bridport hoy beyond us and shouts, &ldquo;George! Oh, George! Wing that duck.
  He&rsquo;s fat!&rdquo; An&rsquo; true as we&rsquo;re all here, that squatty Bridport
  boat rounds to acrost our bows, intending to stop us by means o&rsquo; shooting.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;My Aunt looks over our rail. &ldquo;George,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;you
  finish with your enemies afore you begin on your friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Him that was laying the liddle swivel-gun at us sweeps off his hat an&rsquo;
  calls her Queen Bess, and asks if she was selling liquor to pore dry sailors. My Aunt
  answered him quite a piece. She was a notable woman.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Then <i>he</i> come up&mdash;his long pennant trailing overside&mdash;his
  waistcloths and netting tore all to pieces where the Spanishers had grappled, and his
  sides black-smeared with their gun-blasts like candle-smoke in a bottle. We hooked on
  to a lower port and hung.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, Mus&rsquo; Drake! Mus&rsquo; Drake,&rdquo; I calls up.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He stood on the great anchor cathead, his shirt open to the middle, and his
  face shining like the sun.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, Sim!&rdquo; he says. Just like that&mdash;after twenty year!
  &ldquo;Sim,&rdquo; he says, "what brings you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pudden,&rdquo; I says, not knowing whether to<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> laugh or cry. &ldquo;You
  told me to bring cannon-shot next time, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve brought
  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He saw we had. He ripped out a fathom and a half o&rsquo; brimstone Spanish,
  and he swung down on our rail, and he kissed me before all his fine young captains. His
  men was swarming out of the lower ports ready to unload us. When he saw how I&rsquo;d
  considered all his likely wants, he kissed me again.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a friend that sticketh closer than a brother!&rdquo; he
  says. "Mistress,&rdquo; he says to my Aunt, &ldquo;all you foretold on me was true.
  I&rsquo;ve opened that road from the East to the West, and I&rsquo;ve buried my heart
  beside it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I be come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But ye never foretold this"; he points to both they great fleets.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;This don&rsquo;t seem to me to make much odds compared to what happens
  <i>to</i> a man,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Do it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Certain sure a man forgets to remember when he&rsquo;s proper mucked
  up with work. Sim,&rdquo; he says to me, &ldquo;we must shift every living Spanisher
  round Dunkirk corner on to our Dutch sands before morning. The wind&rsquo;ll come out
  of the North after this calm&mdash;same as it used&mdash;and then they&rsquo;re our
  meat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you what I could
  scutchel up of odds and ends. Be you hit anywhere to signify?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, our folk&rsquo;ll attend to all that when we&rsquo;ve time,&rdquo;
  he says. He turns to talk to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id=
  "Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> Aunt, while his men flew the stuff out of our hold. I
  think I saw old Moon amongst &rsquo;em, but we was too busy to more than nod like. Yet
  the Spanishers was going to prayers with their bells and candles before we&rsquo;d
  cleaned out the <i>Antony</i>. Twenty-two ton o&rsquo; useful stuff I&rsquo;d fetched
  him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now, Sim,&rdquo; says my aunt, &ldquo;no more devouring of Mus&rsquo;
  Drake&rsquo;s time. He&rsquo;s sending us home in the Bridport hoy. I want to speak to
  them young springalds again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s our ship all ready and swept,&rdquo; I says.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Swep&rsquo; an&rsquo; garnished,&rdquo; says Frankie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  going to fill her with devils in the likeness o&rsquo; pitch and sulphur. We must shift
  the Dons round Dunkirk corner, and if shot can&rsquo;t do it, we&rsquo;ll send down
  fireships.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given him my share of the <i>Antony</i>,&rdquo; says my
  Aunt. &ldquo;What do you reckon to do about yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She offered it,&rdquo; said Frankie, laughing.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have if I&rsquo;d overheerd her,&rdquo; I says;
  &ldquo;because I&rsquo;d have offered my share first.&rdquo; Then I told him how the
  <i>Antony&rsquo;s</i> sails was best trimmed to drive before the wind, and seeing he
  was full of occupations we went acrost to that Bridport hoy, and left him.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But Frankie was gentle-born, d&rsquo;ye see, and that sort they never
  overlook any folks&rsquo; dues.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When the hoy passed under his stern, he stood bare-headed on the poop same as
  if my Aunt had been his Queen, and his musicianers played &ldquo;Mary Ambree&rdquo; on
  their silver trumpets quite a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id=
  "Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> while. Heart alive, little maid! I never meaned to make
  you look sorrowful&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <hr style="width: 45%;" />

  <p>Bunny Lewknor in his sackcloth petticoats burst through the birch scrub wiping his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got the stick to rights now! She&rsquo;ve been a whole hatful
  o&rsquo; trouble. You come an&rsquo; ride her home, Mus&rsquo; Dan and Miss
  Una!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They found the proud wood-gang at the foot of the slope, with the log double-chained
  on the tug.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Cattiwow, what are you going to do with it?&rsquo; said Dan, as they
  straddled the thin part.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s going down to Rye to make a keel for a Lowestoft fishin&rsquo;
  boat, I&rsquo;ve heard. Hold tight!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Cattiwow cracked his whip, and the great log dipped and tilted, and leaned and
  dipped again, exactly like a stately ship upon the high seas.</p>

  <p>It was a warm, dark winter day with the Sou&rsquo;-West wind singing through
  Dallington Forest, and the woods below the Beacon. The children set out after dinner to
  find old Hobden, who had a three months&rsquo; job in the Rough at the back of
  Pound&rsquo;s Wood. He had promised to get them a dormouse in its nest. The bright leaf
  still clung to the beech coppice; the long chestnut leaves lay orange on the ground,
  and the rides were speckled with scarlet-lipped sprouting acorns. They worked their way
  by their own short cuts to the edge of Pound&rsquo;s Wood, and heard a horse&rsquo;s
  feet just as they came to the beech where Ridley the keeper hangs up the vermin. The
  poor little fluffy bodies dangled from the branches&mdash;some perfectly good, but most
  of them dried to twisted strips.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Three more owls,&rsquo; said Dan, counting. &lsquo;Two stoats, four jays, and
  a kestrel. That&rsquo;s ten since last week. Ridley&rsquo;s a beast.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;In my time this sort of tree bore heavier fruit.&rsquo; Sir Richard
  Dalyngridge<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class=
  "fnanchor">[7]</a> reined up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id=
  "Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> grey horse, Swallow, in the ride behind them.
  &lsquo;What play do you make?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Nothing, sir. We&rsquo;re looking for old Hobden,&rsquo; Dan replied.
  &lsquo;He promised to get us a sleeper.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Sleeper? A <i>dormeuse</i> do you say?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes, a dormouse, sir.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I understand. I passed a woodman on the low grounds. Come!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>He wheeled up the ride again, and pointed through an opening to the patch of
  beech-stubs, chestnut, hazel, and birch that old Hobden would turn into firewood,
  hop-poles, pea-boughs, and house-faggots before spring. The old man was as busy as a
  beaver.</p>

  <p>Something laughed beneath a thorn, and Puck stole out, his finger on his lip.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;Along between the spindle trees. Ridley has
  been there this half-hour.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The children followed his point, and saw Ridley the keeper in an old dry ditch,
  watching Hobden as a cat watches a mouse.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Huhh!&rsquo; cried Una. &lsquo;Hobden always &rsquo;tends to his wires before
  breakfast. He puts his rabbits into the faggots he&rsquo;s allowed to take home.
  He&rsquo;ll tell us about &rsquo;em to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We had the same breed in my day,&rsquo; Sir Richard replied, and moved off
  quietly, Puck at his bridle, the children on either side between the close-trimmed
  beech stuff.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What did you do to them?&rsquo; said Dan, as they repassed Ridley&rsquo;s
  terrible tree.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That!&rsquo; Sir Richard jerked his head toward the dangling
  owls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Not he,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;There was never enough brute Norman in you
  to hang a man for taking a buck.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I cannot abide to hear their widows screech. But why am I on
  horseback while you are afoot?&rsquo; He dismounted lightly, tapped Swallow on the
  chest, so that the wise thing backed instead of turning in the narrow ride, and put
  himself at the head of the little procession. He walked as though all the woods
  belonged to him. &lsquo;I have often told my friends,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;that
  Red William the King was not the only Norman found dead in a forest while he
  hunted.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;you mean William Rufus?&rsquo; said Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Puck, kicking a clump of red toadstools off a dead log.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;For example, there was a knight new from Normandy,&rsquo; Sir Richard went
  on, &lsquo;to whom Henry our King granted a manor in Kent near by. He chose to hang his
  forester&rsquo;s son the day before a deer-hunt that he gave to pleasure the
  King.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Now when would that be?&rsquo; said Puck, and scratched an ear
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The summer of the year King Henry broke his brother Robert of Normandy at
  Tenchebrai fight. Our ships were even then at Pevensey loading for the war.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What happened to the knight?&rsquo; Dan asked.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;They found him pinned to an ash, three arrows through his leather coat.
  <i>I</i> should have worn mail that day.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;And did you see him all bloody?&rsquo; Dan continued.<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Nay, I was with De Aquila at Pevensey, counting horse-shoes, and arrow
  sheaves, and ale-barrels into the holds of the ships. The army only waited for our King
  to lead them against Robert in Normandy, but he sent word to De Aquila that he would
  hunt with him here before he set out for France.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Why did the King want to hunt so particularly?&rsquo; Una demanded.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;If he had gone straight to France after the Kentish knight was killed, men
  would have said he feared being slain like the knight. It was his duty to show himself
  debonair to his English people as it was De Aquila&rsquo;s duty to see that he took no
  harm while he did it. But it was a great burden! De Aquila, Hugh, and I ceased work on
  the ships, and scoured all the Honour of the Eagle&mdash;all De Aquila&rsquo;s
  lands&mdash;to make a fit, and, above all, a safe sport for our King. Look!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The ride twisted, and came out on the top of Pound&rsquo;s Hill Wood. Sir Richard
  pointed to the swells of beautiful, dappled Dallington, that showed like a
  woodcock&rsquo;s breast up the valley. &lsquo;Ye know the forest?&rsquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;You ought to see the bluebells there in Spring!&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I have seen,&rsquo; said Sir Richard, gazing, and stretched out his hand.
  &lsquo;Hugh&rsquo;s work and mine was first to move the deer gently from all parts into
  Dallington yonder, and there to hold them till the King came. Next, we must choose some
  three <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>hundred
  beaters to drive the deer to the stands within bowshot of the King. Here was our
  trouble! In the mellay of a deer-drive a Saxon peasant and a Norman King may come over
  close to each other. The conquered do not love their conquerors all at once. So we
  needed sure men, for whom their village or kindred would answer in life, cattle, and
  land if any harm come to the King. Ye see?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;If one of the beaters shot the King,&rsquo; said Puck, &lsquo;Sir Richard
  wanted to be able to punish that man&rsquo;s village. Then the village would take care
  to send a good man.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So! So it was. But, lest our work should be too easy, the King had done such
  a dread justice over at Salehurst, for the killing of the Kentish knight (twenty-six
  men he hanged, as I heard), that our folk were half-mad with fear before we began. It
  is easier to dig out a badger gone to earth than a Saxon gone dumb-sullen. And atop of
  their misery the old rumour waked that Harold the Saxon was alive and would bring them
  deliverance from us Normans. This has happened every autumn since Senlac
  fight.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But King Harold was killed at Hastings,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;So it was said, and so it was believed by us Normans, but our Saxons always
  believed he would come again. <i>That</i> rumour did not make our work any more
  easy.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Richard strode on down the far slope of the wood, where the trees thin out. It
  was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
  fascinating to watch how he managed his long spurs among the lumps of blackened
  ling.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But we did it!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;After all, a woman is as good as a man
  to beat the woods, and the mere word that deer are afoot makes cripples and crones
  young again. De Aquila laughed when Hugh told him over the list of beaters. Half were
  women; and many of the rest were clerks&mdash;Saxon and Norman priests.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hugh and I had not time to laugh for eight days, till De Aquila, as Lord of
  Pevensey, met our King and led him to the first shooting stand&mdash;by the Mill on the
  edge of the forest. Hugh and I&mdash;it was no work for hot heads or heavy
  hands&mdash;lay with our beaters on the skirts of Dallington to watch both them and the
  deer. When De Aquila&rsquo;s great horn blew we went forward, a line half a league
  long. Oh, to see the fat clerks, their gowns tucked up, puffing and roaring, and the
  sober millers dusting the undergrowth with their staves; and, like as not, between them
  a Saxon wench, hand in hand with her man, shrilling like a kite as she ran, and leaping
  high through the fern, all for joy of the sport.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>Ah! How! Ah! How! How-ah! Sa-how-ah!</i>&rsquo; Puck bellowed without
  warning, and Swallow bounded forward, ears cocked, and nostrils cracking.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;<i>Hal-lal-lal-lal-la-hai-ie!</i>&rsquo; Sir Richard answered in a high clear
  shout.</p>

  <p>The two voices joined in swooping circles of sound, and a heron rose out of a red
  osier bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
  below them, circling as though he kept time to the outcry. Swallow quivered and swished
  his glorious tail. They stopped together on the same note.</p>

  <p>A hoarse shout answered them across the bare woods.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s old Hobden,&rsquo; said Una.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Small blame to him. It is in his blood,&rsquo; said Puck. &lsquo;Did your
  beaters cry so, Sir Richard?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;My faith, they forgot all else. (Steady, Swallow, steady!) They forgot where
  the King and his people waited to shoot. They followed the deer to the very edge of the
  open till the first flight of wild arrows from the stands flew fair over them.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I cried, &ldquo;&rsquo;Ware shot! &rsquo;Ware shot!&rdquo; and a knot of
  young knights new from Normandy, that had strayed away from the Grand Stand, turned
  about, and in mere sport loosed off at our line shouting: &ldquo;&rsquo;Ware Senlac
  arrows! &rsquo;Ware Senlac arrows!&rdquo; A jest, I grant you, but too sharp. One of
  our beaters answered in Saxon: &ldquo;&rsquo;Ware New Forest arrows! &lsquo;Ware Red
  William&rsquo;s arrow!&rdquo; so I judged it time to end the jests, and when the boys
  saw my old mail gown (for, to shoot with strangers <i>I</i> count the same as war),
  they ceased shooting. So <i>that</i> was smoothed over, and we gave our beaters ale to
  wash down their anger. They were excusable! We&mdash;they had sweated to show our
  guests good sport, and our reward was a flight of hunting-arrows which no man loves,
  and worse, a churl&rsquo;s jibe over hard-fought, fair-lost Hastings fight. So, before
  the next beat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg
  318]</a></span> Hugh and I assembled and called the beaters over by name, to steady
  them. The greater part we knew, but among the Netherfield men I saw an old, old man, in
  the dress of a pilgrim.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The Clerk of Netherfield said he was well known by repute for twenty years as
  a witless man that journeyed without rest to all the shrines of England. The old man
  sits, Saxon fashion, head between fists. We Normans rest our chin on our left palm.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who answers for him?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If he fails in his duty,
  who will pay his fine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who will pay my fine?&rdquo; the pilgrim said. &ldquo;I have asked
  that of all the Saints in England these forty years, less three months and nine days!
  They have not answered!&rdquo; When he lifted his thin face I saw he was one-eyed, and
  frail as a rushlight.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nay but, Father,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to whom hast thou commended
  thyself?&rdquo; He shook his head, so I spoke in Saxon: &ldquo;Whose man art
  thou?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think I have a writing from Rahere, the King&rsquo;s Jester,&rdquo;
  said he after a while. &ldquo;I am, as I suppose, Rahere&rsquo;s man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He pulled a writing from his scrip, and Hugh coming up, read it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;It set out that the pilgrim was Rahere&rsquo;s man, and that Rahere was the
  King&rsquo;s Jester. There was Latin writ at the back.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What a plague conjuration&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; said Hugh, turning it
  over. &ldquo;<i>Pum-quum-sum oc-occ.</i> Magic?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Black Magic,&rdquo; said the Clerk of Netherfield (he had been a monk
  at Battle). &ldquo;They say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg
  319]</a></span> Rahere is more of a priest than a fool and more of a wizard than
  either. Here&rsquo;s Rahere&rsquo;s name writ, and there&rsquo;s Rahere&rsquo;s red
  cockscomb sign drawn below for such as cannot read.&rdquo; He looked slyly at me.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then read it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and show thy learning.&rdquo; He
  was a vain little man, and he gave it us after much mouthing.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The charm, which I think is from Virgilius the Sorcerer, says:
  &lsquo;When thou art once dead, and Minos (which is a heathen judge) has doomed thee,
  neither cunning, nor speechcraft, nor good works will restore thee!&rsquo; A terrible
  thing! It denies any mercy to a man&rsquo;s soul!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Does it serve?&rdquo; said the pilgrim, plucking at Hugh&rsquo;s
  cloak. &ldquo;Oh, man of the King&rsquo;s blood, does it cover me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hugh was of Earl Godwin&rsquo;s blood, and all Sussex knew it, though no
  Saxon dared call him kingly in a Norman&rsquo;s hearing. There can be but one King.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It serves,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;But the day will be long and hot.
  Better rest here. We go forward now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, I will keep with thee, my kinsman,&rdquo; he answered like a
  child. He was indeed childish through great age.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The line had not moved a bowshot when De Aquila&rsquo;s great horn blew for a
  halt, and soon young Fulke&mdash;our false Fulke&rsquo;s son&mdash;yes, the imp that
  lit the straw in Pevensey Castle<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;came thundering up a woodway.</p>

  </div>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said he (though he was a man grown, he called me Uncle),
  "those young Norman fools who shot at you this morn are saying that your beaters cried
  treason against the King. It has come to Harry&rsquo;s long ears, and he bids you give
  account of it. There are heavy fines in his eye, but I am with you to the hilt,
  Uncle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When the boy had fled back, Hugh said to me: &ldquo;It was Rahere&rsquo;s
  witless man cried, &lsquo;&rsquo;Ware Red William&rsquo;s arrow!&rsquo; I heard him,
  and so did the Clerk of Netherfield.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then Rahere must answer to the King for his man,&rdquo; said I.
  &ldquo;Keep him by you till I send,&rdquo; and I hastened down.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The King was with De Aquila in the Grand Stand above Welansford down in the
  valley yonder. His Court&mdash;knights and dames&mdash;lay glittering on the edge of
  the glade. I made my homage, and Henry took it coldly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How came your beaters to shout threats against me?&rdquo; said he.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The tale has grown,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;One old witless man
  cried out, &lsquo;&rsquo;Ware Red William&rsquo;s arrow,&rsquo; when the young knights
  shot at our line. We had two beaters hit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I will do justice on that man,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Who is his
  master?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He is Rahere&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; said I.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Rahere&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Has my fool a
  fool?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I heard the bells jingle at the back of the stand, and a red leg waved over
  it, then a black one. So, very slowly, Rahere the King&rsquo;s Jester<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> straddled the edge of
  the planks, and looked down on us, rubbing his chin. Loose-knit, with cropped hair, and
  a sad priest&rsquo;s face, under his cockscomb cap, that he could twist like a strip of
  wet leather. His eyes were hollow-set.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nay, nay, Brother,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If I suffer you to keep your
  fool, you must e&rsquo;en suffer me to keep mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;This he delivered slowly into the King&rsquo;s angry face! My faith, a
  King&rsquo;s Jester must be bolder than lions!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now we will judge the matter,&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;Let these two
  brave knights go hang my fool because he warned King Henry against running after Saxon
  deer through woods full of Saxons. &lsquo;Faith, Brother, if <i>thy</i> Brother, Red
  William, now among the Saints as we hope, had been timely warned against a certain
  arrow in New Forest, one fool of us four would not be crowned fool of England this
  morning. Therefore, hang the fool&rsquo;s fool, knights!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Mark the fool&rsquo;s cunning! Rahere had himself given us order to hang the
  man. No king dare confirm a fool&rsquo;s command to such a great baron as De Aquila;
  and the helpless King knew it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What? No hanging?&rdquo; said Rahere, after a silence. &ldquo;A
  God&rsquo;s Gracious Name, kill something, then! Go forward with the hunt!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He splits his face ear to ear in a yawn like a fish-pond.
  &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the next time I sleep, do not pester me with thy
  fooleries.&rdquo; Then he throws himself out of sight behind the back of the
  stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;I have seen courage with mirth in De Aquila and Hugh, but stark mad courage
  of Rahere&rsquo;s sort I had never even guessed at.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;What did the King say?&rsquo; cried Dan.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He had opened his mouth to speak, when young Fulke, who had come into the
  stand with us, laughed, and, boy like, once begun, could not check himself. He kneeled
  on the instant for pardon, but fell sideways, crying: &ldquo;His legs! Oh, his long,
  waving red legs as he went backward!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Like a storm breaking, our grave King laughed,&mdash;stamped and reeled with
  laughter till the stand shook. So, like a storm, this strange thing passed!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He wiped his eyes, and signed to De Aquila to let the drive come on.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;When the deer broke, we were pleased that the King shot from the shelter of
  the stand, and did not ride out after the hurt beasts as Red William would have done.
  Most vilely his knights and barons shot!</p>

  <p>&lsquo;De Aquila kept me beside him, and I saw no more of Hugh till evening. We two
  had a little hut of boughs by the camp, where I went to wash me before the great
  supper, and in the dusk I heard Hugh on the couch.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Wearied, Hugh?&rdquo; said I.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I have driven Saxon deer all day for
  a Norman King, and there is enough of Earl Godwin&rsquo;s blood left in me to sicken at
  the work. Wait awhile with the torch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I waited then, and I thought I heard him sob.&rsquo;<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Poor Hugh! Was he so tired?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;Hobden says beating is
  hard work sometimes.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;I think this tale is getting like the woods,&rsquo; said Dan, &lsquo;darker
  and twistier every minute.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Richard had walked as he talked, and though the children thought they knew the
  woods well enough, they felt a little lost.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;A dark tale enough,&rsquo; says Sir Richard, &lsquo;but the end was not all
  black. When we had washed, we went to wait on the King at meat in the great pavilion.
  Just before the trumpets blew for the Entry&mdash;all the guests upstanding&mdash;long
  Rahere comes posturing up to Hugh, and strikes him with his bauble-bladder.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a heavy heart for a joyous meal!&rdquo; he says.
  &ldquo;But each man must have his black hour or where would be the merit of laughing?
  Take a fool&rsquo;s advice, and sit it out with my man. I&rsquo;ll make a jest to
  excuse you to the King if he remember to ask for you. That&rsquo;s more than I would do
  for Archbishop Anselm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hugh looked at him heavy-eyed. &ldquo;Rahere?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The
  King&rsquo;s Jester? Oh, Saints, what punishment for my King!&rdquo; and smites his
  hands together.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Go&mdash;go fight it out in the dark,&rdquo; says Rahere, &ldquo;and
  thy Saxon Saints reward thee for thy pity to my fool.&rdquo; He pushed him from the
  pavilion, and Hugh lurched away like one drunk.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;But why?&rsquo; said Una. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Ah, why indeed? Live you long enough, maiden, and you shall know the meaning
  of many whys.&rsquo; Sir Richard smiled. &lsquo;I wondered too,<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> but it was my duty to
  wait on the King at the High Table in all that glitter and stir.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He spoke me his thanks for the sport I had helped show him, and he had
  learned from De Aquila enough of my folk and my castle in Normandy to graciously feign
  that he knew and had loved my brother there. (This, also, is part of a king&rsquo;s
  work.) Many great men sat at the High Table&mdash;chosen by the King for their wits,
  not for their birth. I have forgotten their names, and their faces I only saw that one
  night. But&rsquo;&mdash;Sir Richard turned in his stride&mdash;&lsquo;but Rahere,
  flaming in black and scarlet among our guests, the hollow of his dark cheek flushed
  with wine&mdash;long, laughing Rahere, and the stricken sadness of his face when he was
  not twisting it about&mdash;Rahere I shall never forget.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;At the King&rsquo;s outgoing De Aquila bade me follow him, with his great
  bishops and two great barons, to the little pavilion. We had devised jugglers and
  dances for the Court&rsquo;s sport; but Henry loved to talk gravely with grave men, and
  De Aquila had told him of my travels to the world&rsquo;s end. We had a fire of
  apple-wood, sweet as incense,&mdash;and the curtains at the door being looped up, we
  could hear the music and see the lights shining on mail and dresses.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Rahere lay behind the King&rsquo;s chair. The questions he darted forth at me
  were as shrewd as the flames. I was telling of our fight with the apes, as ye called
  them, at the world&rsquo;s end.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href=

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He is busy,&rdquo; said Rahere, &ldquo;confirming a new
  miracle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Enough miracles for to-day,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Rahere, you
  have saved your long neck. Fetch the Saxon knight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pest on it,&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;Who would be a King&rsquo;s
  Jester? I&rsquo;ll bring him, Brother, if you&rsquo;ll see that none of your
  home-brewed bishops taste my wine while I am away.&rdquo; So he jingled forth between
  the men-at-arms at the door.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Henry had made many bishops in England without the Pope&rsquo;s leave. I know
  not the rights of the matter, but only Rahere dared jest about it. We waited on the
  King&rsquo;s next word.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think Rahere is jealous of you,&rdquo; said he, smiling, to Nigel of
  Ely. He was one bishop; and William of Exeter, the other&mdash;Wel-Wast the Saxons
  called him&mdash;laughed long. &ldquo;Rahere is a priest at heart. Shall I make him a
  bishop, De Aquila?&rdquo; says the King.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There might be worse,&rdquo; said our Lord of Pevensey. &ldquo;Rahere
  would never do what Anselm has done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;This Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, had gone off raging to the Pope at
  Rome, because Henry would make bishops without <i>his</i> leave either. I knew not the
  rights of it, but De Aquila did, and the King laughed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Anselm means no harm. He should have been a monk, not a bishop,&rdquo;
  said the King. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never quarrel with Anselm or his Pope till
  they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> quarrel
  with my England. If we can keep the King&rsquo;s peace till my son comes to rule, no
  man will lightly quarrel with our England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said De Aquila. &ldquo;But the King&rsquo;s peace ends
  when the King dies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That is true. The King&rsquo;s peace dies with the King. The custom then is
  that all laws are outlaw, and men do what they will till the new king is chosen.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I will amend that,&rdquo; said the King hotly. &ldquo;I will have it
  so that though King, son, and grandson were all slain in one day, <i>still</i> the
  King&rsquo;s peace should hold over all England! What is a man that his mere death must
  upheave a people? We must have the Law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; said William of Exeter; but that he would have said to
  any word of the King.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The two great barons behind said nothing. This teaching was clean against
  their stomachs, for when the King&rsquo;s peace ends, the great barons go to war and
  increase their lands. At that instant we heard Rahere&rsquo;s voice returning, in a
  scurril Saxon rhyme against William of Exeter:</p>

  <p><span class="i2">"Well wist Wal-wist where lay his fortune</span><br />
  <span class="i2">When that he fawned on the King for his crozier,"</span><br /></p>

  <p>and amid our laughter he burst in, with one arm round Hugh, and one round the old
  pilgrim of Netherfield.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Here is your knight, Brother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and for the
  better disport of the company, here is my fool. Hold up, Saxon Samson, the gates of
  Gaza are clean carried away!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg
  327]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hugh broke loose, white and sick, and staggered to my side; the old man
  blinked upon the company.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;We looked at the King, but he smiled.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Rahere promised he would show me some sport after supper to cover his
  morning&rsquo;s offence,&rdquo; said he to De Aquila. &ldquo;So this is thy man,
  Rahere?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;My man he has been, and my
  protection he has taken, ever since I found him under the gallows at Stamford Bridge
  telling the kites atop of it that he was&mdash;Harold of England!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;There was a great silence upon these last strange words, and Hugh hid his
  face on my shoulder, woman-fashion.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It is most cruel true,&rdquo; he whispered to me. &ldquo;The old man
  proved it to me at the beat after you left, and again in our hut even now. It is
  Harold, my King!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;De Aquila crept forward. He walked about the man and swallowed.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Bones of the Saints!&rdquo; said he, staring.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Many a stray shot goes too well home,&rdquo; said Rahere.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The old man flinched as at an arrow. &ldquo;Why do you hurt me still?&rdquo;
  he said in Saxon. &ldquo;It was on some bones of some Saints that I promised I would
  give my England to the Great Duke.&rdquo; He turns on us all crying, shrilly:
  &ldquo;Thanes, he had caught me at Rouen&mdash;a lifetime ago. If I had not promised, I
  should have lain there all my life. What else could I have done? I have lain in a
  strait prison all my life none the less. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328"
  id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> is no need to throw stones at me.&rdquo; He guarded
  his face with his arms, and shivered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now his madness will strike him down,&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;Cast
  out the evil spirit, one of you new bishops.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Said William of Exeter: &ldquo;Harold was slain at Santlache fight. All the
  world knows it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think this man must have forgotten,&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;Be
  comforted, Father. Thou wast well slain at Hastings forty years gone, less three months
  and nine days. Tell the King.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The man uncovered his face. &ldquo;I thought they would stone me,&rdquo; he
  said. "I did not know I spoke before a King.&rdquo; He came to his full towering
  height&mdash;no mean man, but frail beyond belief.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The King turned to the tables, and held him out his own cup of wine. The old
  man drank, and beckoned behind him, and, before all the Normans, my Hugh bore away the
  empty cup, Saxon fashion, upon the knee.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It is Harold!&rdquo; said De Aquila. &ldquo;His own stiff-necked blood
  kneels to serve him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Sit, then, thou that hast been
  Harold of England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The madman sat, and hard, dark Henry looked at him between half-shut eyes. We
  others stared like oxen, all but De Aquila, who watched Rahere as I have seen him watch
  a far sail on the sea.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The wine and the warmth cast the old man into a dream. His white head bowed;
  his hands hung. His eye indeed was opened, but the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> was shut. When he stretched his feet, they
  were scurfed and road-cut like a slave&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, Rahere,&rdquo; cried Hugh, &ldquo;why hast thou shown him thus?
  Better have let him die than shame him&mdash;and me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Shame thee?&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Would any baron of mine kneel
  to me if I were witless, discrowned, and alone, and Harold had my throne?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;I am the sole fool that might do it,
  Brother, unless"&mdash;he pointed at De Aquila, whom he had only met that
  day&mdash;"yonder tough Norman crab kept me company. But, Sir Hugh, I did not mean to
  shame him. He hath been somewhat punished through, maybe, little fault of his
  own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yet he lied to my Father, the Conqueror,&rdquo; said the King, and the
  old man flinched in his sleep.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Rahere, &ldquo;but thy Brother Robert, whose throat
  we purpose soon to slit with our own hands&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hutt!&rdquo; said the King, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep Robert at
  my table for a life&rsquo;s guest when I catch him. Robert means no harm. It is all his
  cursed barons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;None the less,&rdquo; said Rahere, &ldquo;Robert may say that thou
  hast not always spoken the stark truth to him about England. I should not hang too many
  men on <i>that</i> bough, Brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And it is certain,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;that"&mdash;he pointed to
  the old man&mdash;"Harold was forced to make his promise to the Great Duke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Very strongly forced,&rdquo; said De Aquila. He had never any pride in
  the Duke William&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg
  330]</a></span> dealings with Harold before Hastings. Yet, as he said, one cannot build
  a house all of straight sticks.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No matter how he was forced,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;England was
  promised to my Father William by Edward the Confessor. Is it not so?&rdquo; William of
  Exeter nodded. &ldquo;Harold confirmed that promise to my Father on the bones of the
  Saints. Afterwards he broke his oath and would have taken England by the strong
  hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh! La! La!&rdquo; Rahere rolled up his eyes like a girl. &ldquo;That
  ever England should be taken by the strong hand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Seeing that Red William and Henry after him had each in just that fashion
  snatched England from Robert of Normandy, we others knew not where to look; but De
  Aquila saved us quickly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Promise kept or promise broken,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Harold came
  near enough to breaking us Normans at Senlac.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Was it so close a fight, then?&rdquo; said Henry.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A hair would have turned it either way,&rdquo; De Aquila answered.
  &ldquo;His house-carles stood like rocks against rain. Where wast thou, Hugh, in
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Among Godwin&rsquo;s folk beneath the Golden Dragon till your front
  gave back, and we broke our ranks to follow,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But I bade you stand! I bade you stand! I knew it was all a deceit!"
  Harold had waked, and leaned forward as one crying from the grave.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, now we see how the traitor himself was betrayed!&rdquo; said
  William of Exeter, and looked for a smile from the King.&rsquo;<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I made thee Bishop to preach at <i>my</i> bidding,&rdquo; said Henry;
  and turning to Harold, &ldquo;Tell us here how thy people fought us?&rdquo; said he.
  &ldquo;Their sons serve me now against my Brother Robert!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The old man shook his head cunningly. &ldquo;Na&mdash;Na&mdash;Na,&rdquo; he
  cried. &ldquo;I know better. Every time I tell my tale men stone me. But, Thanes, I
  will tell you a greater thing. Listen!&rdquo; He told us how many paces it was from
  some Saxon Saint&rsquo;s shrine to another shrine, and how many more back to the Abbey
  of the Battle.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have trodden it too often to be out even
  ten paces. I move very swiftly. Harold of Norway knows that, and so does Tostig my
  brother. They lie at ease at Stamford Bridge, and from Stamford Bridge to the Battle
  Abbey it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered over many numbers and forgot us.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said De Aquila, all in a muse. &ldquo;That man broke Harold
  of Norway at Stamford Bridge, and came near to breaking us at Santlache&mdash;all
  within one month.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But how did he come alive from Santlache fight?&rdquo; asked the King.
  &ldquo;Ask him! Hast thou heard it, Rahere?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never. He says he has been stoned too often for telling the tale. But
  he can count you off Saxon and Norman shrines till daylight,&rdquo; said Rahere, and
  the old man nodded proudly.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My faith,&rdquo; said Henry after a while, &ldquo;I think even my
  Father the Great Duke would pity if he could see him."<span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

  <p>"How if he <i>does</i> see?&rdquo; said Rahere.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hugh covered his face with his sound hand. &ldquo;Ah, why hast thou shamed
  him?&rdquo; he cried again to Rahere.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; says the old man, reaching to pluck at
  Rahere&rsquo;s cape. &ldquo;I am Rahere&rsquo;s man. None stone me now,&rdquo; and he
  played with the bells on the scollops of it.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How if he had been brought to me when you found him?&rdquo; said the
  King to Rahere.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You would have held him prisoner again&mdash;as the Great Duke
  did,&rdquo; Rahere answered.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said our King. &ldquo;He is nothing except his name. Yet
  that name might have been used by stronger men to trouble my England. Yes. I must have
  made him my life&rsquo;s guest&mdash;as I shall make Robert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;But while this man wandered mad
  by the wayside, none cared what he called himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I learned to cease talking before the stones flew,&rdquo; says the old
  man, and Hugh groaned.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ye have heard!&rdquo; said Rahere. &ldquo;Witless, landless, nameless,
  and, but for my protection, masterless, he can still make shift to bide his doom under
  the open sky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then wherefore didst thou bring him here for a mock and a shame?"
  cried Hugh, beside himself with woe.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A right mock and a just shame!&rdquo; said William of Exeter.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; said Nigel of Ely. &ldquo;I see and I tremble, but I
  neither mock nor judge."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg
  333]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well spoken, Ely.&rdquo; Rahere falls into the pure fool again.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pray for thee when I turn monk. Thou hast given thy blessing on a war
  between two most Christian brothers.&rdquo; He meant the war forward &rsquo;twixt Henry
  and Robert of Normandy. &ldquo;I charge you, Brother,&rdquo; he says, wheeling on the
  King, &ldquo;dost thou mock my fool?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;The King shook his head, and so then did smooth William of Exeter.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;De Aquila, dost thou mock him?&rdquo; Rahere jingled from one to
  another, and the old man smiled.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;By the Bones of the Saints, not I,&rdquo; said our Lord of Pevensey.
  &ldquo;I know how dooms near he broke us at Santlache.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sir Hugh, you are excused the question. But you, valiant, loyal,
  honourable, and devout barons, Lords of Man&rsquo;s Justice in your own bounds, do
  <i>you</i> mock my fool?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He shook his bauble in the very faces of those two barons whose names I have
  forgotten. &ldquo;Na&mdash;Na!&rdquo; they said, and waved him back foolishly
  enough.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;He hies him across to staring, nodding Harold, and speaks from behind his
  chair.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No man mocks thee. Who here judges this man? Henry of
  England&mdash;Nigel&mdash;De Aquila! On your souls, swift with the answer!&rdquo; he
  cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;None answered. We were all&mdash;the King not least&mdash;overborne by that
  terrible scarlet and black wizard-jester.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well for your souls,&rdquo; he said, wiping his brow. Next, shrill
  like a woman: &ldquo;Oh, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg
  334]</a></span> to me!&rdquo; and Hugh ran forward to hold Harold, that had slidden
  down in the chair.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hearken," said Rahere, his arm round Harold&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;The
  King&mdash;his bishops&mdash;the knights&mdash;all the world&rsquo;s crazy chessboard
  neither mock nor judge thee. Take that comfort with thee, Harold of England!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Hugh heaved the old man up and he smiled.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good comfort,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;Tell me again! I have been
  somewhat punished&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Rahere hallooed it once more into his ear as the head rolled. We heard him
  sigh, and Nigel of Ely stood forth, praying aloud.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Out! I will have no Norman!&rdquo; Harold said as clearly as I speak
  now, and he refuged himself on Hugh&rsquo;s sound shoulder, and stretched out, and lay
  all still.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Dead?&rsquo; said Una, turning up a white face in the dusk.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That was his good fortune. To die in the King&rsquo;s presence, and on the
  breast of the most gentlest, truest knight of his own house. Some of us envied
  him,&rsquo; said Sir Richard, and fell back to take Swallow&rsquo;s bridle.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Turn left here,&rsquo; Puck called ahead of them from under an oak. They
  ducked down a narrow path through close ash plantation.</p>

  <p>The children hurried forward, but cutting a corner charged full breast into the
  thorn-faggot that old Hobden was carrying home on his back.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;My! My!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Have you scratted your face, Miss
  Una?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg
  335]</a></span></p>

  <p>&lsquo;Sorry! It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Una, rubbing her nose. &lsquo;How
  many rabbits did you get to-day?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo;s,&rsquo; the old man grinned as he re-hoisted his
  faggot. &lsquo;I reckon Mus&rsquo; Ridley he&rsquo;ve got rheumatism along o&rsquo;
  lyin&rsquo; in the dik to see I didn&rsquo;t snap up any. Think o&rsquo; that
  now!&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They laughed a good deal while he told them the tale.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; just as he crawled away I heard some one hollerin&rsquo; to the
  hounds in our woods,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear? You must ha&rsquo;
  been asleep sure-ly.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, what about the sleeper you promised to show us?&rsquo; Dan cried.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Ere he be&mdash;house an&rsquo; all!&rsquo; Hobden dived into the
  prickly heart of the faggot and took out a dormouse&rsquo;s wonderfully woven nest of
  grass and leaves. His blunt fingers parted it as if it had been precious lace, and
  tilting it toward the last of the light he showed the little, red, furry chap curled up
  inside, his tail between his eyes that were shut for their winter sleep.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s take him home. Don&rsquo;t breathe on him,&rsquo; said Una.
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll make him warm and he&rsquo;ll wake up and die straight off.
  Won&rsquo;t he, Hobby?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a heap better by my reckonin&rsquo; than wakin&rsquo; up and
  findin&rsquo; himself in a cage for life. No! We&rsquo;ll lay him into the bottom
  o&rsquo; this hedge. Dat&rsquo;s jus&rsquo; right! No more trouble for him till come
  Spring. An&rsquo; now we&rsquo;ll go home.&rsquo;</p>
